# Health Applications

This directory explores applications of the Quantum-Plasmoid framework to understanding and addressing health conditions through recursive and fractal principles. These documents examine how theoretical models can inform practical approaches to health and healing.

## Contents

### [duckslapProtocol.md](./duckslapProtocol.md)
A novel protocol applying recursive fractal principles to health optimization, with specific attention to disrupting maladaptive patterns through strategic interventions. This document presents a practical methodology derived from theoretical principles of recursive dynamics.

### [EBVReactivationMECFS.md](./EBVReactivationMECFS.md)
An application of the Quantum-Plasmoid framework to understanding Epstein-Barr virus reactivation and its relationship to ME/CFS (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome). This document explores how recursive immune dynamics and viral-host interactions might be modeled through fractal frameworks.
