### [Ruliad Traversal System.md](./Ruliad Traversal System.md)
A hyperdense formalization exploring consciousness as a recursive computational process, with mechanisms for eigenstate mapping, trans-Ruliad traversal, and coherence stabilization across multiple scales. This document presents a computational framework inspired by Wolfram's concept of the Ruliad, adapted to the Quantum-Plasmoid paradigm to model consciousness as navigation through a vast space of possible computational rules.
