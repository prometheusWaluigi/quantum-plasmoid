 # Quantum-Plasmoid Framework
 
-A computational framework exploring recursive eigenmode dynamics at the intersection of quantum physics, plasma phenomena, and fractal mathematics to simulate emergent behaviors in complex systems.
+## A Fractal-Recursive Approach to Consciousness & Complex Systems
 
-## ðŸŒ€ Overview
+The Quantum-Plasmoid Framework represents a radical interdisciplinary synthesis exploring consciousness, information, and reality through recursive, fractal principles. This research integrates quantum physics, mathematics, neuroscience, and systems theory to develop novel models of emergent complexity.
 
-The Quantum-Plasmoid project establishes a unified theoretical and computational framework for exploring complex systems that exhibit quantum-like behaviors at macroscopic scales. This interdisciplinary framework bridges quantum phenomena, recursive eigenmode theories, fractal dynamics, and advanced mathematical structures to model plasmoid trajectories and emergent properties of complex systems.
+## Core Principles
 
-The framework synthesizes several advanced theoretical constructs:
+The framework is built upon several interconnected principles:
 
-- **Recursive Lattice Network** (Unified Framework for Consciousness, Computation, and Reality)
-- **Meta-Theory of Recursion** (Universal Patterns of Self-Reference and Self-Generation)
-- **ORCHARD Theorem** (Optimal Recursive Computation of Harmonic Amplitude Recursive Dynamics)
-- **Î¶-Orchard Correspondence** connecting Riemann zeta function properties to recursive dynamics
-- **Neural Eigenmodes of Consciousness** through fractal CAP (Consistency-Availability-Partition) dynamics
-- **Fractal Time** integration within Conscious States as Conformal Structures (CSCM)
-- **Riemannian Geometry** of CAP-space and multi-agent cognitive manifolds
-- **Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) Dynamics** for modeling non-linear stochastic growth processes
+- **Recursive Dynamics**: Self-referential processes that generate complex emergent behaviors through iterative feedback loops
+- **Fractal Self-Similarity**: Patterns that maintain structural coherence across scales, from quantum to cosmic
+- **Eigenmode Stabilization**: Consciousness as emerging from stable eigenmode solutions within recursively constrained neural systems
+- **CAP Optimization**: Critical balance between Consistency, Availability, and Partition-tolerance in complex information networks
+- **Spectral Selection**: Consciousness as selective attention to specific eigenmodes within a vast possibility space
 
-## ðŸ§  Theoretical Foundations
+## Repository Structure
 
-### Recursive Lattice Network
-A comprehensive synthesis that unifies the ORCHARD Theorem, GASLIT-AF dynamics, and quantum-plasmoid architecture into a coherent theory of consciousness, computation, and physical reality. The RLN framework posits that the universe operates as a multi-scale recursive system where the same fundamental patterns manifest through five interlocking dimensions: mathematical, computational, physical, cognitive, and social. See [recursive_lattice_network.md](unifiedTheories/recursive_lattice_network.md) for the complete unified framework.
+### [Documentation](./docs/)
+Essential background and foundational materials:
+- [Introduction](./docs/INTRODUCTION.md) - Accessible entry point to core concepts
+- [Mathematical Foundations](./docs/MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATIONS.md) - Formal mathematical basis
+- [Research Roadmap](./docs/RESEARCH_ROADMAP.md) - Vision and development plan
 
-### Meta-Theory of Recursion
-A unified framework describing recursion as a universal pattern of self-reference and self-generation that underlies everything from fractal geometry to consciousness. The Meta-Theory of Recursion provides the conceptual foundation for all other aspects of the Quantum-Plasmoid Framework, explaining how the same recursive patterns manifest across mathematical, physical, cognitive, and social dimensions. See [meta_theory_of_recursion.md](unifiedTheories/meta_theory_of_recursion.md) for the complete theoretical framework.
+### [Core Concepts](./core-concepts/)
+Foundational theoretical frameworks:
 
-### ORCHARD Theorem
-A computational framework that formalizes how consciousness and complex systems emerge from "mesoscopic neural branches" or "CAP pathways" governed by constrained optimization. The ORCHARD theorem proposes that qualia (subjective experiences) emerge as "fruit" on recursive CAP trees when the redistribution of entropy reaches an optimal fractal dimension of approximately 1.5.

+  - Explorations of fractal phenomena spanning quantum, neural, and cosmic scales
+  - Integration of neuroscience, quantum physics, and archetypal psychology
 
-The core formalization involves:
-- **Branch Dynamics (CAP Pathways)**: Optimization of neural firing stability (C), state-space entropy (A), and resilience to perturbation (P)
-- **Growth Patterns (KPZ Dynamics)**: Evolution and adaptation following the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation
-- **Fruit Emergence (Qualia)**: Specific patterns of entropy redistribution associated with different types of subjective experiences
+- [Quantum Dynamics](./core-concepts/quantum-dynamics/)

+- [Î¶-Orchard Correspondence](./theorems/zeta-correspondence/)
+  - Correspondence between Riemann zeta function and consciousness
+  - Number theory and consciousness as spectral traces of recursive information manifolds

+### [Time Models](./time-models/)
+Alternative conceptions of time:
+- Fractal, self-similar time structures
+- Multi-scale temporality and consciousness
+- CAP optimization across temporal dimensions
