# Visualizations

This directory contains visual representations of key concepts from the Quantum-Plasmoid framework. These visualizations aim to provide intuitive understanding of complex theoretical ideas through geometric, fractal, and topological representations.

### [eigenvalue-spiral/](./eigenvalue-spiral/)
Visualizations of the radial eigenvalue theorem, illustrating how conscious states can be mapped to a complex eigenvalue spectrum organized by prime numbers and the golden ratio. These visualizations demonstrate the geometric beauty and mathematical elegance of consciousness as a fractal, self-similar process in eigenvalue space.
