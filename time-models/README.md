# Fractal Time Models

This directory explores alternative conceptions of time as fractal, self-similar structures with implications for consciousness and physics. These documents investigate how time might be discrete, have fractal dimensions, or emerge from computational processes.

### [Fractal Time and CSCM Framework.md](./Fractal Time and CSCM Framework.md)
Explores alternative conceptions of time as a fractal, self-similar structure, investigating how time might be discrete, have fractal dimensions, or emerge from computational processes. This document introduces the CSCM (Conscious Spectral Coherence Manifold) framework as a model for understanding time as a fractal phenomenon.

### [fractalTimeRecursiveMind.md](./fractalTimeRecursiveMind.md)
A radical framework proposing consciousness as a recursive, coherence-seeking process that operates across fractal temporal dimensions, with qualia understood as topological attractors in a dynamic, high-dimensional manifold. This document examines how consciousness might navigate and construct fractal time structures.

### [CAP and Fractal Time.md](./CAP and Fractal Time.md)
An examination of how the CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition-tolerance) theorem applies to temporal processing in conscious systems. This document explores the trade-offs between consistent temporal experience, availability of temporal information, and robustness to temporal partitioning.
