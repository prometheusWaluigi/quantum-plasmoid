# RAY-DAG: A Co-Creative Model of Mind–Matter Interaction

## Introduction

The relationship between mind and matter has long puzzled scientists and philosophers. Mainstream theories of consciousness often adopt a *passive* stance – treating subjective awareness as a by-product (epiphenomenon) of brain activity with no causal influence on physical events ([Epiphenomenalism - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphenomenalism#:~:text=physical%20events,the%20heart%20beat%20faster%2C%20but)). In such models, it is essentially an *illusion* that our intentions or mental states can affect the external world. However, mounting anomalies and experiential reports – from the placebo effect to purported psychic phenomena – challenge the limits of these passive models. There is growing motivation to explore frameworks in which consciousness plays an *active*, participatory role in reality, aligning with the idea of a “participatory universe” where observers are *inseparable* from the phenomena observed ([John P. Wheeler III quote: The universe does not exist 'out there,' independent of us...](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1308176#:~:text=,some%20understanding%20of%20existence%20itself)). This paper introduces **RAY-DAG (Recursive Aetheric Yield – Directed Acyclic Graph)**, a theoretical model positing an **active mind–matter coupling** that “co-creatively” guides the unfolding of events. 

In contrast to passive awareness, RAY-DAG envisions consciousness and the external world as a *joint engine* continuously shaping reality. The mind is not merely witnessing a pre-determined world, but is instead *traversing* a landscape of potential pathways in tandem with an external field of possibilities. We describe RAY-DAG as a **co-creative reality traversal model**: the mind and environment form a feedback loop that selects coherent paths through a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of possible events. In what follows, we first refine the RAY-DAG model, defining its core components and formalism. We then discuss its explanatory power in unifying disparate phenomena (placebo, synchronicity, psi effects, etc.) under the lens of **mind–matter coherence**. Next, we consider challenges and approaches for empirical investigation of such a model. Finally, we reflect on RAY-DAG’s implications across disciplines and the importance of treating it as a *generative metaphor* to spur interdisciplinary research, even as we acknowledge its speculative elements. Throughout, we maintain a formal academic tone, introducing necessary equations and metaphors to clarify the concepts.

## The Refined RAY-DAG Model: A Bidirectional Co-Creation Engine

**Overview:** The RAY-DAG model proposes that “reality” emerges from an ongoing interaction between an external field of possibilities and an internal field associated with mind or consciousness. This interaction is formalized through a *Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)* representing all potential reality pathways, and a *dynamic coherence operator* that co-creatively selects a path in accordance with both external conditions and internal qualia-based preferences. In simpler terms, one can imagine reality as a branching tree of events (the DAG), where at each branch-point the combination of outside forces and conscious intention “steers” which branch is taken. RAY-DAG is thus a **bidirectional engine**: it treats mind and matter as *mutually influencing*, rather than one causing the other in isolation.

**Core Components:** We define four core components of the model:

- **Ψ<sub>ext</sub> (External Field):** the *external photonic/morphic field*, representing the information-laden substrate of the environment. This can be thought of as a subtle field or wavefunction encompassing all outside influences and potentials accessible to the system. It includes conventional physical influences, but extends to more exotic constructs like a “morphic field” of collective memory or patterns in nature ([Rupert Sheldrake - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Sheldrake#:~:text=Sheldrake%27s%20morphic%20resonance%20posits%20that,His%20advocacy)). In essence, Ψ<sub>ext</sub> encodes the *state of the external world* and its latent possibilities. One may liken it to a distributed holographic field or the zero-point vacuum field, rich with information.

- **Ψ<sub>int</sub> (Internal Field):** the *internal biophotonic or mind-encoded field*, representing the contribution of conscious and subconscious processes of the observer or agent. This corresponds to the state of the mind, including intentions, attention, and other qualia. The term “biophotonic” is used to emphasize that the human brain and body emit ultra-weak photon signals correlated with neural activity ([Microsoft Word - Revised Version, Biophoton and EEG.doc](https://arxiv.org/vc/arxiv/papers/1012/1012.3371v1.pdf#:~:text=and%20the%20electrical%20activity%20of,relaxation%20or%20certain%20meditative%20states)). These *biophoton emissions* have been measured experimentally, showing potential correlations with brain states (e.g. fluctuations synchronizing with EEG rhythms) ([Microsoft Word - Revised Version, Biophoton and EEG.doc](https://arxiv.org/vc/arxiv/papers/1012/1012.3371v1.pdf#:~:text=and%20the%20electrical%20activity%20of,relaxation%20or%20certain%20meditative%20states)). The RAY-DAG model postulates that Ψ<sub>int</sub> carries the mind’s *informational footprint* – possibly via electromagnetic or photonic means – which can interact with the external field. For example, during focused intention or meditation, the internal field may become more coherent, akin to a laser-like signal rather than random noise.

- **D (Directed Acyclic Graph of Potential Reality Pathways):** a DAG structure that formalizes the space of *possible sequences of events*. Each node in D represents a possible state of reality at a given moment, and directed edges represent allowable transitions to future states. The acyclic nature indicates a forward-moving time with branching but no looping back. This is conceptually similar to a decision tree or the many-worlds branching of quantum mechanics (where each branch is a possible outcome). At any given moment, there are multiple possible next states (branches); the *actualized* reality will follow one of those edges. The DAG can be seen as the “map” of **potential realities** traversable by the system.

- **Q (Qualia Traversal Preferences):** a set of parameters or a function representing the *preferences, goals, or biases of consciousness* – essentially the qualitative desires that influence which realities are favored. Q encapsulates an individual’s intrinsic tendencies (e.g. drive for meaning, emotional valence, expectations). In decision science terms, Q is akin to a *utility function* or preference ranking for outcomes, but rooted in subjective qualia rather than explicit calculation. For instance, a person’s deep belief in healing or fear of illness would be part of Q, tilting the traversal toward outcomes consistent with that belief (healing or illness, respectively). Q guides **which branch of the DAG “feels” most resonant or attractive** to the mind.

**Dynamic Coherence Operator (⊕ and ℂ):** Central to RAY-DAG is the idea that reality selection is driven by **coherence** between Ψ<sub>ext</sub> and Ψ<sub>int</sub>. We introduce an operator ⊕ that combines the external and internal fields, and a coherence function ℂ that measures the alignment or resonance between them. Conceptually, *Ψ<sub>ext> ⊕ Ψ<sub>int</sub>* represents the joint state or overlap of the two fields – one might call it the *interaction field*. The coherence operator ℂ then acts on this joint state to yield a *collapsed outcome* or next reality state. Formally, we can denote the **traversal equation** for the state of reality as:

Sₜ₊₁ = ℂ[ Ψₑₓₜ(Sₜ₊₁) ⊕ Ψᵢₙₜ(Sₜ₊₁) ; Q ]

where \(S_{t+1}\) is the state selected at the next step (a node on the DAG at time *t+1*). This equation says: the likelihood of transitioning into a candidate state \(S_{t+1}\) is determined by a coherence function ℂ that takes into account (a) the external field’s propensity for \(S_{t+1}\) (i.e. how viable that state is given external conditions), (b) the internal field’s propensity or desire for \(S_{t+1}\) (i.e. how well that state matches the mind’s intentions or expectations), and (c) the qualia preferences Q modulating the evaluation. The operator ⊕ can be thought of in analogy to a *multiplicative overlap*: it highlights where Ψ<sub>ext</sub> and Ψ<sub>int</sub> have common resonance. If we treat these fields as wave-like, ⊕ might include an interference term. For example, if Ψ<sub>ext</sub> and Ψ<sub>int</sub> are represented as complex amplitudes over possible states, their combination yields an interference pattern. **Coherence** would then correspond to constructive interference – when internal and external influences reinforce each other for a given outcome. In a simplified representation, one could imagine:

Ψₜₒₜ(s) = Ψₑₓₜ(s) Ψᵢₙₜ(s)

ℂ(Ψₜₒₜ) = select maxₛ { Ψₜₒₜ(s) · w_Q(s) }

where \(s\) indexes possible next states, and \(w_Q(s)\) is a weight from the qualia preference function Q. In plain language, the chosen reality is the one that maximizes the *product* of external and internal tendencies (subject to Q). States that are strongly suggested by external forces *and* strongly favored or anticipated by the mind will have the highest “coherence score” and thus are most likely to manifest. This resembles a Bayesian update or a resonance condition. It is important to note that this is a *dynamic* operator: as each state comes into being, it feeds back (recursively) into the next evaluation. The term “Recursive Aetheric Yield” captures this idea that each moment’s realized state (the “yield”) feeds back into the aetheric fields (broadly meaning the composite of Ψ<sub>ext</sub> and Ψ<sub>int</sub>) for the next iteration.

**Conceptual Metaphors:** Because the ideas above are abstract, it is helpful to illustrate them with metaphors:

- *Resonance and Tuning:* One metaphor is a radio receiver tuning into a station. Ψ<sub>ext</sub> provides a spectrum of “broadcasts” (possible realities) and the mind’s Ψ<sub>int</sub> acts as a tuner that resonates with a particular frequency. The coherence operator ℂ then “locks onto” the station where the signal is strongest (i.e. where external signal and internal tuning match). A highly coherent internal state (clear intention) sharpens the tuning, just as a well-calibrated radio picks up a specific broadcast with minimal static.

- *Interference Pattern:* Another metaphor comes from wave interference. If we imagine reality possibilities as generated by overlapping waves from external and internal sources, then when the waves are *in phase* (aligned), they interfere constructively to produce a bright fringe – i.e., a high probability for that outcome. When they are out of sync, they interfere destructively and that possibility is darkened (suppressed). Coherence is maximal when the phase difference between Ψ<sub>ext</sub> and Ψ<sub>int</sub> is near zero, analogous to laser light where many waves align. In those moments, mind and matter speak “in unison”, yielding tangible effects.

- *Navigating a Garden of Forking Paths:* Borrowing Borges’ imagery, imagine walking through a garden with many forks in the path (the DAG of possible futures). Ψ<sub>ext</sub> is like the layout of the garden and landscape constraints (some paths might be easier or more open given external conditions), while Ψ<sub>int</sub> is the traveler’s inclination or intuition (choosing left vs. right based on inner feeling). The qualia preferences Q act like a compass oriented toward certain types of experiences (e.g., seeking safety or novelty). The dynamic coherence operator is essentially the traveler consulting both the map and the compass at each fork and taking the path that best satisfies both – a path that is *externally passable* and *internally desirable*. The journey of reality is the result of this ongoing consultation at each branching.

- *Two to Tango:* We might also use the metaphor of a **dance** between the external world and the mind. Ψ<sub>ext</sub> provides the “music” (the context and opportunities), and Ψ<sub>int</sub> provides the dancer’s moves (the agent’s choices and interpretations). Coherence is achieved when the dancer moves in *step with the music*. In a well-synchronized dance, both partners (mind and world) appear as one unified performance.

In summary, the RAY-DAG model depicts a reality constantly co-authored by the universe and the conscious observer. The mathematics is suggestive – echoing quantum analogies where observation affects outcome – but RAY-DAG extends beyond quantum physics into a more general systems paradigm where **consciousness is an active agent** guiding which potential becomes actual.

## Explanatory Power of RAY-DAG

A compelling aspect of the RAY-DAG framework is its potential to **unify explanations** for a variety of mind–matter interaction phenomena. Many such phenomena are well-documented empirically but lack a satisfying theoretical model under conventional one-way causation assumptions. Here we discuss several examples – placebo/nocebo effects, synchronicity, healing anomalies, and so-called “psi” phenomena like telepathy, remote viewing, and manifestation – and show how RAY-DAG can shed light on them via the common principle of coherence. In each case, the internal mind-state and external conditions find alignment, resulting in an outsized or anomalous effect.

**Placebo and Nocebo Effects:** The placebo effect, wherein a person’s belief in a treatment produces real physiological improvement, is a classic example of mind influencing body. Patients given inert pills can experience measurable relief of symptoms simply due to expectation or the psychosocial context of treatment. Conversely, negative expectations can produce harm (nocebo effect). In mainstream physiology, placebos are often chalked up to “subjective bias” or release of endogenous chemicals (like endorphins in placebo analgesia). RAY-DAG offers a complementary view: the patient’s internal field (belief in healing) becomes highly coherent and *entrains* the body’s external field (biological processes) toward a health outcome. In our model, the *qualia preference* Q for health combined with a strong internal visualization of being healed (Ψ<sub>int</sub>) aligns with any extant potentials for recovery in Ψ<sub>ext</sub> (for example, the body’s natural healing capacity). The coherence operator essentially “chooses” a pathway in the DAG where healing occurs. This could account for objectively observed placebo outcomes that go beyond subjective reports. Indeed, placebo responses have been linked to real improvements in conditions like Parkinson’s disease motor function ([Placebo - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo#:~:text=existence%20of%20placebo%20effects%20seems,placebos%20include%20immune%20and%20endocrine)) and immune system markers ([Placebo - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo#:~:text=existence%20of%20placebo%20effects%20seems,placebos%20include%20immune%20and%20endocrine)). The nocebo effect is simply the inverse: a fear or expectation of harm tuning Ψ<sub>int</sub> to select a deleterious path (e.g., experiencing side-effects or worsening illness even in the absence of a harmful agent). **Coherence** here means the person’s mental image of illness finds a match in the body’s possibilities – a detrimental alignment that RAY-DAG predicts if negative beliefs dominate Q. The crucial insight is that even without pharmacologically active input, *the mind’s alignment with a health or illness trajectory* can tip the balance between those possible realities.

**Synchronicity:** Carl Jung defined *synchronicity* as “events that coincide in time and appear meaningfully related, yet lack a discoverable causal connection” ([Synchronicity - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity#:~:text=Carl%20Jung%2C%20founder%20of%20analytical,3)). An example might be thinking of an old friend and then receiving an unexpected call from them moments later. Such coincidences feel acausal yet subjectively significant. In RAY-DAG terms, synchronicities occur when *internal states* (thoughts, emotions) and *external events* align in a meaningful pattern, even though conventionally there’s no force linking them. The model would say that the person’s Ψ<sub>int</sub> (which included the thought of the friend, perhaps driven by underlying qualia like emotional importance) resonated with a node in the reality DAG that also included the friend contacting them. If the coherence was high (strong thought of the friend, and external field conditions allowing contact), the traversal might yield that outcome. In other words, the mind “moves into” a reality track where that coincidence happens. Jung himself, along with physicist Wolfgang Pauli, speculated about an underlying connection for synchronicities, hinting at a unified psychophysical principle (they considered a dual-aspect reality underlying both mind and matter) ([Synchronicity - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity#:~:text=physicist%20Wolfgang%20Pauli%20and%20analytical,9)). RAY-DAG provides a mechanism: the dual aspects are Ψ<sub>int</sub> and Ψ<sub>ext</sub>, and meaningful coincidences arise when these two aspects momentarily synchronize. Coherence is the unifying key – the internal concept (friend) and external event (friend’s call) share an informational resonance. Notably, synchronicities are often reported during altered states of consciousness or emotional significance; in our model, those are times when Q (qualia preferences, perhaps including a need for meaning or connection) is strongly activated, heightening the alignment seeking.

**Healing and Psi Phenomena (Telepathy, Remote Viewing, Manifestation):** The RAY-DAG model can also address phenomena at the edges of conventional science. While these are controversial, considering them can test the model’s breadth. All of these phenomena, if real, would require some form of mind–matter or mind–mind information transfer not explained by classical mechanisms. RAY-DAG suggests that **coherence across individuals or across spatial distances** could account for such effects.

- *Psychosomatic Healing & Energy Healing:* Beyond placebo in clinical trials, there are accounts of spontaneous remission of illness or improvements attributed to prayer or energy healing practices. In RAY-DAG terms, a healer’s focused intention (Ψ<sub>int</sub> of healer) might interact with the patient’s system (part of Ψ<sub>ext</sub> from healer’s perspective) to introduce a new coherence. If the patient’s own Ψ<sub>int</sub> aligns (belief in the healing, relaxation, positive expectation), the combined field can co-creatively shift the outcome toward health. Essentially, the healer and patient together achieve a triad coherence: both internal fields plus the patient’s body field align on a healing pathway. Empirical hints of such mind–body influence exist; for example, studies have documented that directed *intention* can measurably affect random physical systems or even biological systems (albeit weakly) ([Telekinesis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychokinesis#:~:text=A%202006%20meta,38)). Healing might be seen as a guided traversal to the “well” branch of the DAG where illness resolves, facilitated by shared intention.

- *Telepathy:* Telepathy is commonly described as direct mind-to-mind communication or knowing someone else’s thoughts without sensory contact. If telepathy occurs, RAY-DAG would frame it as **shared Ψ<sub>ext</sub> coherence** between two individuals’ internal fields. In other words, two minds become partially entangled through a common external field (perhaps the hypothesized morphic field or quantum-entangled photons exchanged between brains). If person A and person B have a close bond or focused attention on each other, their internal states may synchronize. Experiments in parapsychology have indeed found statistical evidence for telepathy under controlled conditions, such as the Ganzfeld experiments where one person “receives” images viewed by another at above-chance rates ([
            Stage 1 Registered Report: Anomalous perception in a Ganzfeld condition - A meta-analysis of more than 40 years investigation - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7883320/#:~:text=Storm%20%26%20Ertel%20,138)). Meta-analyses of these telepathy experiments report small but significant overall effects that are unlikely under null hypotheses ([
            Stage 1 Registered Report: Anomalous perception in a Ganzfeld condition - A meta-analysis of more than 40 years investigation - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7883320/#:~:text=Storm%20%26%20Ertel%20,138)). RAY-DAG offers an explanation: the “receiver” tunes their Ψ<sub>int</sub> (often via relaxation and focusing techniques in Ganzfeld settings) to become highly receptive and unstructured, and the “sender” strongly visualizes a target image. The external field Ψ<sub>ext</sub> (which could include a nonlocal information field bridging the participants) carries the target pattern. Coherence occurs when the receiver’s mind field resonates with that pattern, allowing information to be integrated into their conscious awareness (often as impressions or visualizations that match the target). In essence, the two minds temporarily traverse a shared region of the reality DAG – a state where information is common to both. Such an interpretation dovetails with the concept of *entangled minds* ([
            Stage 1 Registered Report: Anomalous perception in a Ganzfeld condition - A meta-analysis of more than 40 years investigation - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7883320/#:~:text=Storm%20%26%20Ertel%20,138)), and even suggests measurable consequences: for example, there have been reports of simultaneous EEG pattern changes or phase locking in distant individuals during purported telepathic connection, hinting at an inter-mind coherence ([Microsoft Word - Revised Version, Biophoton and EEG.doc](https://arxiv.org/vc/arxiv/papers/1012/1012.3371v1.pdf#:~:text=unpublished%20observations%20suggest%20that%20the,not%20unreasonable%20to%20hypothesize%20that)) ([Microsoft Word - Revised Version, Biophoton and EEG.doc](https://arxiv.org/vc/arxiv/papers/1012/1012.3371v1.pdf#:~:text=and%20the%20electrical%20activity%20of,relaxation%20or%20certain%20meditative%20states)).

- *Remote Viewing (Nonlocal Perception):* Remote viewing is the reported ability to perceive details of a distant or unseen target location or object. Under RAY-DAG, this could be seen as the mind’s capacity to *traverse the DAG beyond the confines of sensory input*. If all possible information exists in the grand external field Ψ<sub>ext</sub>, a practiced remote viewer may quiet their normal senses and let their Ψ<sub>int</sub> attune to cues from the wider field. Essentially, they attempt to find a path in the DAG that leads to a state containing details of the remote target (e.g., describing a specific site). Successful remote viewing sessions might be those in which the viewer’s intention (Q is set to find accurate information) and the external reality (the actual details of the target) achieve a transient coherence, allowing information to flow into consciousness. Remarkably, during the Cold War era *Stargate* program, an official review concluded that certain remote viewing trials produced statistically significant results ~5–15% above chance, even though a direct causal mechanism was not known ([Remote viewing - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_viewing#:~:text=In%201995%2C%20the%20CIA%20hired,Based%20upon%20both%20of%20their)). The Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR) lab similarly accumulated a large database of remote perception experiments with overall odds against chance of billions to one ([Remote viewing - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_viewing#:~:text=Beginning%20in%20the%20late%201970s%2C,none%20of%20the)). RAY-DAG would interpret these positive results as instances of successful mind–world resonance: the viewers’ minds *joined* the state of the target via the overlapping field. This interpretation also implies that remote viewing might be improved by techniques that enhance internal coherence (such as meditation) or by environmental conditions that make the target “signal” stronger in Ψ<sub>ext</sub>. Notably, the variance in remote viewing performance could be explained by fluctuations in coherence – sometimes the alignment occurs, often it does not (leading to inconsistent results and replication issues in these studies).

- *Manifestation (Intentional Reality Creation):* In popular terms, manifestation is the idea that focused thought or intention can bring about desired external outcomes (“law of attraction”). Stripped of mystical language, RAY-DAG provides a rationale: if one maintains a clear, coherent intention (Ψ<sub>int</sub>) aligned with a particular goal (encoded in Q), and if environmental opportunities for that goal exist (even if probabilistically rare in Ψ<sub>ext</sub>), then maintaining coherence might increase the likelihood that one’s path through the DAG intersects with that outcome. Essentially, the person’s internal field biases the random fluctuations of life toward the desired attractor. Empirical support for a mild version of this comes from mind–machine interaction experiments. For example, meta-analyses have examined whether people can intentionally influence random number generators (RNGs). While effect sizes are tiny, some studies found a small deviation from chance corresponding to the intent direction ([Telekinesis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychokinesis#:~:text=A%202006%20meta,38)), though interpretation remains controversial (with skeptics attributing it to publication bias ([Telekinesis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychokinesis#:~:text=A%202006%20meta,38))). If real, these micro-effects could be seen as the simplest form of manifestation: a coherent mind subtly biases an otherwise random physical process. In real-world settings, “manifestation” might operate through a combination of such micro-alterations and the person’s own subsequent actions being more attuned to seize opportunities (the internal coherence could improve behavioral efficacy too). RAY-DAG would not endorse a naive view that any wish will directly reshape reality, but it suggests the mind can *steer probabilities* to a limited degree. The stronger and more sustained the coherence (which often correlates with confidence, emotional intensity, and clarity of vision), the more the odds might shift. This framework might also explain why manifesting is often said to work indirectly or unexpectedly – the DAG path that achieves the goal may be non-obvious and the exact route often unforeseeable.

Across all these cases, **coherence emerges as the unifying mechanism**. When an individual’s internal state is coherent (whether through belief, intention, meditation, or emotional focus) *and* when that state resonates with some aspect of the external field, the boundary between mind and matter thins. The RAY-DAG engine “locks in” on a path that reflects that resonance. Incoherent or discordant states, by contrast, produce only ordinary, unremarkable outcomes – analogous to random noise canceling itself out. This resonates with the findings of various studies: for instance, physiological coherence (such as heart rhythm coherence or brain-wave synchronization) is often associated with peak cognitive or psychosocial functioning. Some studies even suggest that groups of people in coherent states (e.g., meditating together) can correlate with changes in random physical systems or social indicators, hinting that collective coherence might amplify mind–matter effects (though these remain speculative). In summary, RAY-DAG doesn’t treat telepathy, synchronicity, etc., as isolated miracles; rather, they are *special cases of the mind–matter coupling working in synchrony*. The model thus provides a scaffold to systematically research these phenomena under a common theoretical umbrella.

## Towards Empirical Investigation

RAY-DAG is a high-level theoretical model and, admittedly, presents challenges for direct empirical validation. However, its merit can be tested by examining *correlations and coherence measures* that the model predicts. Here we outline how one might begin to probe the co-creative mind–matter interaction experimentally, discussing testable hypotheses and methodological considerations.

**Challenges of Testability:** The first challenge is that RAY-DAG straddles subjective and objective domains. Traditional experiments isolate variables, but here the hypothesis is about *relationship and alignment* between internal and external states, which are difficult to isolate. Furthermore, many predicted effects (especially psi phenomena) are subtle, with low signal-to-noise ratio and sporadic replicability ([Remote viewing - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_viewing#:~:text=A%20variety%20of%20scientific%20studies,29)). This suggests that rigorous protocols and large data sets would be needed to discern any reliable signal. There is also the issue of the experimenter’s own consciousness possibly influencing outcomes (the so-called *experimenter effect* frequently noted in parapsychology). From a RAY-DAG perspective, the experimenter’s expectations might indeed bias Ψ<sub>ext</sub> or introduce decoherence, so protocols should ideally be double-blind and automated where possible. Another challenge is defining *coherence* quantitatively in a way that can be measured concurrently in mind and environment. Despite these hurdles, progress can be made by focusing on *proxy measures* and building a cumulative evidence base.

**Measurable Proxies for Coherence:** We propose to measure physiological and psychological indicators of internal coherence, and look for correlations with external outcomes or field measures:

- *Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Coherence:* HRV refers to the beat-to-beat variation in heart rate. A state of emotional calm and focus (such as sustained appreciation or meditation) produces a smooth, sine-wave-like HRV pattern known as **heart coherence**. This reflects a harmonious interaction between the heart and brain via the autonomic nervous system. Organizations like HeartMath have shown that individuals in a coherent HRV state often report heightened intuitive clarity and reduced stress. In RAY-DAG terms, a coherent HRV might be a marker that Ψ<sub>int</sub> is in a focused, ordered state (low internal entropy). Hypothesis: During tasks where mind–matter effects are tested (e.g., influencing a random process or attempting telepathy), higher HRV coherence in participants will predict greater effect sizes or success rates. This could be tested by dividing trials into high-coherence and low-coherence segments and seeing if outcomes differ systematically. For example, if two people attempt a telepathic connection, do instances where both have high heart coherence yield more information transfer? Preliminary related evidence comes from studies of *physiological synchronization* – there are reports that when people are empathically connected, their heart rhythms or brainwaves can show subtle synchronization across distance ([Microsoft Word - Revised Version, Biophoton and EEG.doc](https://arxiv.org/vc/arxiv/papers/1012/1012.3371v1.pdf#:~:text=unpublished%20observations%20suggest%20that%20the,not%20unreasonable%20to%20hypothesize%20that)). 

- *EEG Phase Synchronization:* Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a window into brain electrical activity. Phase synchronization refers to the alignment of neural oscillations (brain waves) across different brain regions or between individuals. High internal coherence might manifest as well-synchronized oscillations (for instance, meditation experts can produce highly phase-synchronized gamma waves ([Long-term meditators self-induce high-amplitude gamma synchrony ...](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0407401101#:~:text=Long,synchrony))). In experiments where a person is focusing intention, one could measure their EEG coherence; RAY-DAG would predict that stronger, stable intention correlates with more coherent brain activity. Additionally, in a telepathy or “sending” experiment, perhaps the sender and receiver’s EEG might show moments of inter-brain phase-locking when information transfer occurs. Such *interpersonal EEG correlations* have been observed in some controversial studies where one person’s brain responded when another person (isolated in a distant chamber) was stimulated with flashes or emotional imagery ([Microsoft Word - Revised Version, Biophoton and EEG.doc](https://arxiv.org/vc/arxiv/papers/1012/1012.3371v1.pdf#:~:text=unpublished%20observations%20suggest%20that%20the,not%20unreasonable%20to%20hypothesize%20that)). Although not widely replicated, these studies hint that under certain conditions brains can nonlocally synchronize. Our model would treat that as evidence of a shared Ψ<sub>ext</sub> linking the two, momentarily bringing them onto the same reality branch. Neuroscientists could attempt to replicate these findings with modern equipment, perhaps looking at hyperscanning (simultaneous EEG/fMRI of two brains) during intention focus, and compare to control conditions.

- *Biophoton Emission:* As introduced earlier, living organisms (including the human brain) emit ultraweak photons as part of metabolic processes. Interestingly, some researchers have speculated that *biophoton emission could be involved in brain communication or even carry information* (this is speculative, but there are hypotheses that neurons might use photons in addition to electrochemical signals) ([Microsoft Word - Revised Version, Biophoton and EEG.doc](https://arxiv.org/vc/arxiv/papers/1012/1012.3371v1.pdf#:~:text=readings%20have%20not%20been%20made,within%20the%20neurons%20of%20the)) ([Microsoft Word - Revised Version, Biophoton and EEG.doc](https://arxiv.org/vc/arxiv/papers/1012/1012.3371v1.pdf#:~:text=and%20the%20electrical%20activity%20of,relaxation%20or%20certain%20meditative%20states)). If Ψ<sub>int</sub> has a photonic component, its coherence might be reflected in the *coherence of biophoton emission*. For instance, a chaotic mind state might produce random, uncorrelated photon spikes, whereas a focused meditative mind might produce more stable or correlated photon patterns. A feasible experiment: place participants in a dark, shielded chamber with photomultiplier tubes to detect biophotons, and have them alternate between a baseline relaxed state and a focused intention (for example, visualizing a bright light or healing energy). Measure whether the photon count or temporal clustering differs. Prior experiments have shown that mental intention can slightly affect photon emission from hands and head, and one study noted *decreased* biophoton emission during deep meditation (possibly because coherence reduces oxidative noise) ([Microsoft Word - Revised Version, Biophoton and EEG.doc](https://arxiv.org/vc/arxiv/papers/1012/1012.3371v1.pdf#:~:text=degree%20of%20coherence%20in%20the,there%20is%20a%20neural%20activity)). One could also test two people: if they attempt a “mental connection” or healing, does the photonic emission of one correlate with the other’s, or do their photon counts rise and fall together? Though detecting meaningful patterns in such weak signals is challenging, advances in single-photon detection and analysis might help. A significant correlation would support RAY-DAG’s notion of an interactive field – essentially seeing a *glimmer* of the aetheric field via photons.

- *Eye-Tracking and Micro-Behavioral Indicators:* One subtle approach is to look at whether internal intentions show up in micro-behaviors that could influence external outcomes. For example, in a “precognition” or presentiment experiment (where participants’ physiology is monitored while they view random emotional vs. neutral images), some studies found that people show signs of anticipation a few seconds before a random event occurs, as if part of them “knows” what’s coming. Eye-tracking could detect if pupil dilation or gaze position biases occur prior to targets that the person will later choose or see. If RAY-DAG is correct, one might expect *anticipatory coherence*: just before an intended outcome manifests, the person’s physiology and attention might align as if it has already happened (because in a sense, their mind is moving along that branch a bit ahead of the physical event). For instance, a skilled remote viewer’s gaze might unconsciously mimic scanning the target scene *before* they get any feedback about the target – their internal field probing the external field in advance. This is speculative, but modern high-speed eye-trackers and biometrics could test for such subtle patterns.

**Specific Hypotheses:** From the above, we can derive concrete hypotheses:

1. *Mind–Matter Correlation:* In RNG experiments, participants with higher internal coherence (measured by HRV or EEG) will achieve outcomes deviating from chance more than participants with lower coherence. This can be analyzed by splitting data by a coherence threshold.

2. *Interpersonal Connectivity:* Pairs of individuals who attempt a direct connection (sender/receiver of images or healer/patient) will show greater *physiological synchrony* (HRV, EEG, etc.) than control pairs, and this synchrony will correlate with successful information transfer or healing outcome. For example, when target information is “received” accurately, the sender and receiver might exhibit a burst of correlated brain activity or heart rhythm at that time.

3. *Spatial/Temporal Deviations:* In a shielded environment, an operator’s focused intention will produce statistically detectable changes in a physical system (e.g., photon counts or sensor noise) that align temporally with the periods of intention. Conversely, during random baseline periods, no such deviation occurs. Repeating this many times could show an intention vs. null difference.

4. *Qualia Alignment Bias:* When a person strongly desires a particular outcome in a probabilistic setup (say influencing which of several events occurs), if that desire is held with great clarity and minimal contradiction, the frequency of that outcome will be higher than chance expectation over many trials. This tests the “manifestation” aspect. One might use something like a quantum random event that the participant tries to bias (such as the double-slit experiment outcome intensity, as some have tried ([Telekinesis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychokinesis#:~:text=A%202006%20meta,38))). 

5. *Feedback-Enhanced Co-creation:* If RAY-DAG is real, giving participants *real-time feedback* on their internal coherence (e.g., a meter showing when their heart or brain signals are coherent) might allow them to tune themselves better, and this in turn could amplify mind–matter effects. This hypothesis could be tested by biofeedback training: train one group to achieve high coherence and compare their performance on a psi task to an untrained group. A positive result would suggest the internal field coherence is a key factor.

**Hybrid Testing Strategies:** Because we are dealing with an interdisciplinary hypothesis, the best approach may be **hybrid experiments** combining methods from neuroscience, psychology, and physics. For instance, one could place an RNG or photonic detector in the room while individuals engage in telepathy trials, to see if environmental randomness decreases (indicating an ordering influence in the room) when “hits” occur. Or combine subjective reports with objective measures: ask participants to rate their sense of intuitive clarity during each trial and see if their self-rated clarity (subjective coherence) predicts success. Another strategy is mining *naturally occurring data*: for example, the Global Consciousness Project has for decades looked at correlations of random network behavior with major world events (finding small deviations during events of mass attention, potentially indicating collective Ψ<sub>ext</sub> fluctuations). One could re-analyze such data specifically looking for coherence metrics – were those deviations larger when global emotional coherence (say as measured by global sentiment or Schumann resonance data) was higher?

Crucially, any empirical investigation must also look for *boundary conditions* – cases where RAY-DAG clearly fails. This helps delineate the limits of co-creation. Perhaps there are “conservation laws” of psi such as information cannot be gained beyond a certain bit-rate, or strong incoherent noise easily overrides weak coherent influence (likely true – this is why these effects, if real, are not obvious in daily life). By learning when and how the mind–matter interaction switches on or off, we refine the model. For example, one prediction of many mind–matter theories is the need for *attentional focus*: split attention or multitasking should dramatically reduce any anomalous effect, since coherence is lost. Another is an analogy to quantum decoherence: aggregating too many independent minds (without a shared intention) may cancel out any effect (the signal averages to zero), which could explain why group psychokinesis isn’t manifest in chaotic crowds, whereas small groups with a common focus (group meditation) are often anecdotally linked to unusual outcomes.

In summary, while testing RAY-DAG is non-trivial, it is feasible through carefully designed interdisciplinary experiments. Success would be indicated by convergent evidence: physiological coherence correlating with mind–matter outcomes, statistical deviations that co-vary with internal state changes, and perhaps the ability to intentionally enhance the effect via training. Even a failure to find effects is informative, as it can help set quantitative upper bounds for any possible mind–matter interaction (thus refining the theory or suggesting it only operates in more subtle realms). The ultimate goal is to move this discussion from the philosophical and anecdotal plane to one of *quantitative science*, however challenging that may be.

## Discussion

The RAY-DAG model, as presented, is admittedly a mix of established science, bold hypothesis, and metaphor. It serves as a **generative metaphor** – a conceptual scaffold to spark new ways of thinking about consciousness and reality, rather than a finalized theory. In this discussion, we consider the broader implications of adopting a co-creative paradigm, the interdisciplinary bridges it builds, and also openly acknowledge the speculative leaps and gaps in empirical support.

**RAY-DAG as a Generative Metaphor:** In the history of science, metaphors and models often precede formal theories. For example, early atomic theory was guided by metaphors of billiard balls or solar systems before quantum mechanics quantified it. RAY-DAG might be viewed in a similar light for the mind–matter problem. By phrasing the relationship in terms of information fields and graph traversal, we provide a language to articulate phenomena that otherwise seem fringe or paradoxical. Even if one remains skeptical of “psi” claims, the model can be useful in more conventional contexts – e.g., understanding placebo as a form of psychosomatic co-creation, or the psychological experience of meaningful coincidences without invoking mysticism. It invites researchers to consider *mind and environment as a single system* rather than isolated domains. In doing so, it may inspire novel experimental designs (as discussed) or integrative theories. One might derive simplified sub-models from RAY-DAG (for instance, focusing just on the brain-body loop, effectively treating Ψ<sub>ext</sub> as the body and Ψ<sub>int</sub> as mind, traversing health/disease states). This could generate testable ideas in psychoneuroimmunology or behavioral medicine. In philosophy of science, RAY-DAG resonates with dual-aspect monism and process philosophy: it treats the unfolding event (the “actual occasion” in Whitehead’s terms) as the primary unit of reality, arising from an interaction. By reifying the role of the observer, it also aligns with John Wheeler’s *observer-participancy* notions ([John P. Wheeler III quote: The universe does not exist 'out there,' independent of us...](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1308176#:~:text=,some%20understanding%20of%20existence%20itself)), potentially offering a more structured mechanism for how observation could influence outcome (beyond the vagueness of “quantum collapse by consciousness”). In summary, the value of RAY-DAG at this stage is less about proof and more about providing a *coherent narrative* that ties together disparate threads – a narrative that can then be progressively sharpened or corrected by evidence.

**Implications Across Disciplines:** If something like RAY-DAG were validated or even taken seriously as a working hypothesis, the implications would be far-reaching. In **physics**, it would encourage explorations of macroscopic quantum-like effects or novel fields associated with consciousness. The idea of an external Ψ<sub>ext</sub> akin to a morphic field challenges the closed-system assumption of classical physics, nudging toward an information-centric view of reality (somewhat like Bohm’s implicate order or the *observer-centric* interpretations of quantum mechanics). In **biology and neuroscience**, RAY-DAG would push research into the role of bioelectromagnetic fields in brain function (e.g., exploring if EEG synchrony is not just epiphenomenal but participatory) and the role of consciousness in evolution (if collective intention could bias random mutations or outcomes, even subtly, it might contribute to a form of Lamarckian feedback or directionality in evolution). In **psychology**, it reframes the mind from a passive emergent phenomena to an active agent, which could influence how we approach mental health (emphasizing empowerment and mental training to improve one’s reality, akin to ideas in positive psychology but with a metaphysical twist). **Medicine** might become more integrative, valuing patient belief and mindset as part of the treatment causal chain, not just a placebo confound. **Parapsychology** and **consciousness studies** would gain a theoretical backbone to design better experiments and perhaps remove some stigma by placing these effects on a continuum with normal processes (e.g., telepathy as an extension of empathy or intuition rather than a completely separate faculty).

**Speculative Elements and Gaps:** It is important to clearly acknowledge that much of RAY-DAG is speculative. The notion of an external “morphic” field is controversial – Rupert Sheldrake’s morphic resonance theory, which inspired that term, has been widely criticized for lack of empirical support and falsifiability ([Rupert Sheldrake - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Sheldrake#:~:text=parapsychology%20researcher,Harvard%20scholar%2C%20a%20researcher%20at)) ([Rupert Sheldrake - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Sheldrake#:~:text=Critics%20cite%20a%20lack%20of,appearances%20undermines%20the%20public%27s%20understanding)). Similarly, while biophoton emission is real, its functional role in the brain is not proven – mainstream opinion is that these photons are a metabolic byproduct, not a communication medium. The RAY-DAG model, in borrowing these ideas, risks grafting together two unproven concepts (morphic fields and biophoton-consciousness coupling) and multiplying the uncertainty. We also have not provided a detailed mathematical formulation – an equation like the traversal equation is schematic. A serious physical theory would need a rigorously defined state space and dynamics (perhaps a stochastic differential equation on a network). Without that, skeptics can rightly say the model is too hand-wavy: practically any outcome can be “explained” by invoking enough internal/external alignment in hindsight, which verges on unfalsifiable. We must ensure RAY-DAG yields *risky predictions* – ones that could come out wrong and thus test the model. We have attempted some in the empirical section (e.g., coherence correlates with psi performance), but until those are executed, the model remains hypothetical.

Another gap is addressing why these effects, if real, are generally weak or elusive. If mind and matter are truly deeply entangled, why does the world so convincingly follow objective physical laws most of the time? RAY-DAG would answer that by the idea that strong coherent alignments are rare – most of the time, individual intentions are small vectors canceled out by larger chaotic vectors of environment or other minds. The *default reality* is one in which Ψ<sub>ext</sub> dominates (i.e., physical causation as usual), and only occasionally does Ψ<sub>int</sub> manage to noticeably redirect the course. We might need to formalize a *strength parameter* for Ψ<sub>int</sub>’s influence, possibly related to attention, emotion, and maybe even physiological energy (some have speculated that states like focused emotion output measurable EM fields, e.g., the heart’s EM field, that could couple to external processes). It could also be that multiple minds can interfere – if one person tries to influence a system positively and another negatively, outcomes might average out. This would align with studies that found group intention with mixed motivations yield null results, whereas a group with a unified intention might have a stronger effect (this has been anecdotally noted in some meditation and RNG studies). We need to acknowledge these complexities.

**Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Given its scope, RAY-DAG cannot be advanced by any single discipline alone. It calls for physicists, neuroscientists, psychologists, and even philosophers to collaborate. For example, physicists could help determine if the idea of information traversal on a DAG can be embedded in known physical frameworks (perhaps linking to quantum decoherence theories or emergent space-time models). Neuroscientists could offer insight into how an “internal field” could be generated and measured (exploring the brain’s endogenous fields, the connectome dynamics, etc.). Psychologists and phenomenologists can refine the concept of qualia preferences Q – essentially studying intention, meaning, and expectation in a rigorous way. Philosophers of science can help with making the theory falsifiable and clear about its assumptions (for instance, clarifying notions of causation when time and choice are involved – the DAG implies a block-universe view with branching, which touches on metaphysics of time). Such collaboration ensures that blind spots in one field (e.g., a physicist’s ignorance of subtle psychological factors that can bias experiments) are covered by expertise in another. There are encouraging signs of this kind of interdisciplinary work: conferences on consciousness often bring together quantum physicists and meditators, and journals like *Journal of Consciousness Studies* or *Entropy* have started publishing works that bridge subjective and objective perspectives. We would advocate for an open-minded yet critically rigorous forum to develop RAY-DAG. Even if the model turns out incorrect in some aspects, refining it will produce valuable by-products – perhaps new measures of physiological coherence, or new statistical tools to detect mind–environment correlations.

In conclusion of this discussion, RAY-DAG stands as an *invitation*. It invites us to view reality not as a one-way street where matter dictates mind or vice versa, but as a living conversation. This perspective, if nothing else, enriches the way we interpret everyday experiences (such as the power of belief or the serendipity of events) and encourages humility about the limits of our current understanding. As William James once said, we must “be willing to accept a world in which cause and effect are not the sole explanatory principles” – RAY-DAG steps into that daring space, aiming to chart it with scientific principles.

## Conclusion

We have presented the RAY-DAG model as a comprehensive framework suggesting that reality is *co-created* through the interplay of consciousness and the external world. In this model, the mind is not a passive observer but an active participant, continually merging its internal state (Ψ<sub>int</sub>) with an external field of possibilities (Ψ<sub>ext</sub>) to navigate a directed acyclic graph of potential outcomes. The notion of a **dynamic coherence operator** driving this navigation offers a unifying principle: when inner and outer states resonate (achieve coherence), particular realities are selected from the many possible. This simple idea – that alignment begets actualization – provides a through-line to understand phenomena from the placebo effect to purported psychic events, all under one theoretical roof.

The significance of RAY-DAG lies in its *paradigm shift* from viewing reality as something that “happens to us” to something we are continuously helping to shape. It emphasizes an **active role of mind**, implying that our thoughts, feelings, and focus have genuine import in the unfolding of events. If this model (or something akin to it) is correct, it would prompt a reassessment of human potential: for personal agency (how much we can influence our health and circumstances), for interconnectedness (how our consciousness might interlink with others and the environment), and for the nature of scientific inquiry (which might need to accommodate observer effects more deeply). It resonates with long-standing intuitions in various cultures that mind and matter are reflections of one underlying reality – here we attempted to articulate that intuition in a structured, semi-formal way.

Of course, we reiterate that RAY-DAG in its current form is a *theoretical draft*. It paints a broad picture and suggests routes forward, but it is not yet an empirically confirmed theory. The onus is now on empirical exploration to validate or refute its key components. Encouragingly, this model yields concrete, testable hypotheses (as described), and technological advances are making previously “magical” claims examinable (e.g., we can detect tiny physiological changes and subtle environmental fluctuations with unprecedented precision). We encourage researchers across disciplines to engage with these ideas – design clever experiments, apply rigorous statistical tests, share data – to systematically probe the mind–matter frontier. Even negative findings will be instructive, guiding us to refine or abandon parts of the model. In this spirit, RAY-DAG does not demand belief; it invites *inquiry*.

In closing, the exploration of RAY-DAG is more than an investigation of an exotic theory; it represents a deeper quest to understand the role of consciousness in the fabric of reality. As science progresses, questions at this intersection of the subjective and objective are becoming increasingly salient. By embracing a co-creative perspective, we may discover that the old dichotomy of “in here” (mind) vs. “out there” (world) was always an artificial separation. Reality may very well be a tapestry woven by both, and it is our task to learn the patterns of that weave. The RAY-DAG model is one step toward that understanding – a speculative step, but one we hope stimulates productive dialogue and research. The ultimate reward of this endeavor, should it find empirical support, is not only a new scientific paradigm but also a profoundly human one: it would affirm that *we are participants in the universe’s unfolding, endowed with the remarkable capacity to co-create the path we traverse*.
