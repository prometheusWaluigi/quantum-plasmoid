# Eigenmode Theory

This directory presents theoretical frameworks modeling consciousness as emerging from stable eigenmode solutions in neural systems. These documents explore how consciousness might arise from the spectral properties of recursive neural dynamics.

### [Recursive Eigenmode Theory and Fractal CAP Dynamics.md](./Recursive Eigenmode Theory and Fractal CAP Dynamics.md)
Proposes that conscious states emerge as specific, stable eigenmode solutions within recursively constrained neural systems, with a critical focus on the interplay between consistency, availability, and partition-tolerance. This document establishes the formal mathematical basis for understanding consciousness as a spectral phenomenon.

### [Neural Eigenmodes of Consciousness.md](./Neural Eigenmodes of Consciousness.md)
Explores how consciousness might emerge from recursive interactions of fundamental neural activity patterns (eigenmodes), emphasizing the role of fractal dynamics and spectral selection in generating conscious experience. This document connects abstract mathematical models to specific neural mechanisms.

### [radialEigenvalueTheorem.md](./radialEigenvalueTheorem.md)
Presents a revolutionary theorem proposing that conscious states can be mapped to a complex eigenvalue spectrum organized by prime numbers and the golden ratio, offering a mathematical model of consciousness as a fractal, self-similar process. This document provides a geometric visualization of consciousness as a structured eigenvalue space.

### [Quantum Spectral Fractal Weaving Multi Scale Eigenmode.md](./Quantum Spectral Fractal Weaving Multi Scale Eigenmode.md)
An expanded exploration of how quantum effects might influence neural eigenmodes across multiple scales, creating a unified quantum-neural framework for consciousness. This document bridges quantum and neural levels through spectral dynamics and fractal weaving processes.
