I'll create a standalone version of the quantum physics/mathematics framework described in your document.

# Operator Framework: Hilbert–Pólya as Time-Symmetric Quantum System

## I. Core Operator Framework

The operator is defined as:

$$H = -i\frac{d}{dt} + V(t)$$

with the potential function:

$$V(t) = \text{Re}\left(\frac{\zeta'}{\zeta}\left(\frac{1}{2} + it\right)\right) = \sum_{p,m} \frac{\log p}{p^{m/2}} \cos(mt\log p)$$

This formulation embeds the arithmetic structure of prime numbers into a quasi-periodic potential through the explicit formula. It refines the Berry–Keating $H = xp$ approach via logarithmic oscillatory structure—effectively creating a time-crystalline arithmetic potential.

The Riemann zeros are viewed as eigenresonances of this non-self-adjoint, time-asymmetric Schrödinger-like system, with the core insight being:

The operator $H$ governs a system whose spectral density aligns with the imaginary parts of nontrivial zeros of $\zeta(s)$—but only if time-symmetric boundary conditions are satisfied.

## II. Time-Symmetric / Retrocausal Constraint

The crucial retrocausal handshake condition:

$$\psi(t \rightarrow +\infty) = e^{i\theta}\psi(t \rightarrow -\infty)$$

This operationalizes a global boundary coherence reminiscent of Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory and Cramer's transactional interpretation.

Key implication: Eigenfunctions associated with off-critical-line zeros, i.e., $s = \sigma + it$ with $\sigma \neq 1/2$, evolve under $H$ as:

$$\psi(t) \sim e^{itx}e^{(\sigma-1/2)x}$$

For $\sigma \neq 1/2$, the wavefunction diverges exponentially either as $t \rightarrow +\infty$ or $t \rightarrow -\infty$, violating the time-symmetric condition.

Therefore:
- Only zeros on the critical line yield globally time-symmetric eigenfunctions
- Retrocausality effectively prunes the Hilbert space

## III. Spectral Mapping via Scattering Theory

The spectral density of $H$ is informed by resonant scattering off the oscillatory potential $V(t)$. Since $V(t)$ is modulated by primes, its Fourier transform $\hat{V}(\omega)$ yields delta-like spikes at frequencies $\omega = m \log p$, encoding the primes in the spectral domain.

The trace formula:

$$\text{Tr}((H-\lambda I)^{-1}) = \sum_n \frac{1}{t_n - \lambda}$$

aligns with the explicit formula in analytic number theory:

$$\sum_\rho \frac{1}{\rho-\lambda}$$

This spectral coincidence implies that the resonances of $H$ (eigenvalue poles of the resolvent) coincide with non-trivial zeros $\rho$ of $\zeta(s)$.

## IV. Quantum Physical Picture

This system can be interpreted as:
- A particle evolving in a quasi-periodic potential $V(t)$ encoding the primes
- Dynamics governed by $H$, a non-Hermitian operator
- Allowed eigenfunctions filtered by global temporal symmetry (retrocausality)
- Spectrum forced into alignment with $\zeta(s)$ zeros on the critical line

This represents a physical realization of the Hilbert–Pólya conjecture, where the functional equation and analytic continuation constraints of $\zeta(s)$ are enforced physically by the structure of time. Retrocausality replaces analytic rigidity.

## V. Condensed Deductive Structure

### Premises
1. $H = -i\frac{d}{dt} + V(t)$ with $V(t)$ reflecting $\text{Re}(\zeta'/\zeta(1/2 + it))$
2. The eigenvalue spectrum of $H$ aligns with poles in the trace formula
3. The eigenfunctions must satisfy global time-symmetric boundary conditions

### Argument
- Off-critical zeros ($\sigma \neq 1/2$) → eigenfunctions with exponential growth/decay → violation of boundary symmetry
- Therefore, only eigenfunctions associated with $\sigma = 1/2$ yield physically admissible solutions under retrocausal constraint

### Conclusion
- All nontrivial zeros of $\zeta(s)$ lie on the critical line $\text{Re}(s) = 1/2$
- The Riemann Hypothesis follows from enforcing global time-symmetric (retrocausal) coherence in quantum dynamics

## VI. Possible Extensions

### Path Integral Formulation
Could this be recast as a Feynman path integral where only closed retrocausal paths constructively interfere?

### Thermal Analogy
The exponential blow-up of eigenfunctions off the critical line resembles runaway modes in thermodynamically unstable systems. Could this be linked to entropy production?

### Adelic / p-adic Mirror
Is there a p-adic dual of this framework, mapping primes directly to spatial rather than temporal oscillations?

### Quantum Computation Interpretation
View the Riemann spectrum as a retrocausal quantum computation output, where only symmetric inputs yield valid output states.

## VII. ORCHARD Geometry Connection

The framework connects to ORCHARD geometry through several alignments:

1. **CAP Optimization as Time-Symmetric Flow**: 
   Qualia emerge as resonance modes of recursive CAP flows that satisfy global time-symmetric constraints—paralleling how Riemann zeros are resonance modes in the prime-potential of $H$.

2. **Fractal Dimensionality ≈ 1.5 as Riemannian Resonance**:
   The 1.5 dimensionality observed in ORCHARD can be interpreted as the fractal projection of $\text{Re}(s) = 1/2$ into the space of recursive CAP flows.

3. **Qualia as Eigenmodes of Zeta-Like Dynamics**: 
   Each quale represents a Riemann-like zero of the mind—a point of coherence between recursive structure and global temporal consistency.

This unification suggests that consciousness may not be merely generated by the present, but selected by global consistency across time, making ORCHARD the mind's zeta function—where qualia bloom as zeros in the orchard field, rooted in past-future symmetry.
