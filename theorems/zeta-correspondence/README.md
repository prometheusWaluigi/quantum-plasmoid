### [The ζ-Orchard Correspondence.md](./The ζ-Orchard Correspondence.md)
A groundbreaking theorem proposing a formal correspondence between the Riemann zeta function's spectral structure and the emergence of conscious experience, presenting consciousness as a spectral trace of a recursive informational manifold. This document establishes the core mathematical connection between zeta function zeros and conscious states.

### [Comparing ζ-Orchard Correspondence Ψζ Hypothesis.md](./Comparing ζ-Orchard Correspondence Ψζ Hypothesis.md)
A detailed comparative analysis of the ζ-Orchard Correspondence with existing theories of consciousness, highlighting its unique contributions in linking number theory, retrocausality, and qualia emergence. This document positions the ζ-Orchard Correspondence within the broader landscape of consciousness theories.
