# Paper 2: Quantum-Fractal Criticality

**Citation:** Synthesis from multiple sources (Wolfram, Tononi, Friston, Zurek)

**Summary:**
- The "edge-of-chaos" or criticality is where systems exhibit maximal adaptability and information integration.
- Fractal and recursive structures in biology support robust, multi-scale information flow.
- Quantum coherence may enable unified experience at these critical points.

**Unique Insight:**
- Consciousness may require quantum-coherent fractal networks operating at criticality.

**Follow-up:**
- Simulate a quantum-fractal network at criticality and measure its information integration (Î¦).
