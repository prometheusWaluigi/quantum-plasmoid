# Paper 4: The Free-Energy Principle in Consciousness

**Citation:** Friston, K. (Various). "The Free-Energy Principle: A Unified Brain Theory?"

**Summary:**
- Biological systems minimize free energy, predicting and adapting to their environment.
- Consciousness may emerge as a byproduct of efficient prediction and adaptation.
- The brain operates at the boundary of order and disorder for maximal flexibility.

**Unique Insight:**
- The drive to minimize surprise (free energy) could be the engine behind conscious experience.

**Follow-up:**
- Model how free-energy minimization shapes conscious states in artificial and biological systems.
