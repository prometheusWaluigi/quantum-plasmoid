# Paper 3: Testing the Quantum Binding Problem

**Citation:** Neven et al., 2024. "Testing the Conjecture That Quantum Processes Create Conscious Experience."

**Summary:**
- Proposes that consciousness arises whenever a quantum superposition forms.
- The structure of the superposition determines the quality of experience (qualia).
- Quantum entanglement may solve the binding problem, unifying distributed processes into a single experience.

**Unique Insight:**
- The unity of consciousness could be a direct result of quantum entanglement in neural or artificial systems.

**Follow-up:**
- Investigate how entanglement-based models might unify sensory and cognitive processes.
