# Paper 5: Quantum Darwinism and Emergent Reality

**Citation:** Zurek, W. (Various). "Quantum Darwinism."

**Summary:**
- The classical world emerges from quantum reality through a selection process.
- Only certain quantum states survive decoherence and become "objective reality."
- Reality is a consensus of many observers.

**Unique Insight:**
- The process of decoherence and selection in quantum systems may parallel the emergence of shared conscious reality among observers.

**Follow-up:**
- Explore how consensus and selection mechanisms could operate in conscious systems.
