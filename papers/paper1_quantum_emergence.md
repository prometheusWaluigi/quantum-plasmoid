# Paper 1: Consciousness as an Emergent Phenomenon

**Citation:** MDPI, 2020. "Consciousness as an Emergent Phenomenon: A Tale of Different Levels of Description."

**Summary:**
- Proposes that consciousness emerges from both large-scale classical and subcellular quantum networks.
- Conscious states occur at a "Goldilocks" point of network complexity and energy dissipation.
- Quantum coherence may play a role in fine-tuning conscious states.

**Unique Insight:**
- Systems that maximize both complexity and energy dissipation at criticality may be the most likely to support consciousness.

**Follow-up:**
- Explore how fractal, multi-scale networks can be engineered or simulated to hover at this optimal point.
