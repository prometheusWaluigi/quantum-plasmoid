**Core Proposal:**  
The theory posits that conscious states are not a product of computation itself, but rather specific, stable "eigenmode solutions" that arise within globally constrained, recursive neural systems. Think of it like finding the natural resonant frequencies (eigenmodes) of a complex system (the brain), where these specific frequencies correspond to subjective experiences (qualia).  
**Key Concepts:**

1. **Consciousness as Spectral Selection:** Instead of emerging complex computations, consciousness is proposed to be the result of selecting specific stable states (eigenmodes) from a spectrum of possibilities within the brain's dynamics.  
2. **Recursive Neural Systems:** The theory emphasizes the recursive or self-referential nature of neural processing across different scales or "depths" (indexed by r).  
3. **Critical Fractal Dimension (d\_f ≈ 1.5):** A crucial condition for the emergence of stable conscious states is that the neural architecture operates near a critical fractal dimension of approximately 1.5. This value is suggested as an optimal balance point between order and chaos, differentiation and integration, necessary for stable yet flexible conscious binding.  
4. **CAP Trilemma:** Neural dynamics are described as optimizing a trade-off between three factors:  
   * **Consistency (C):** Temporal stability and autocorrelation.  
   * **Availability (A):** The range of accessible states or entropy.  
   * **Partition-tolerance (P):** Resilience to disruptions or noise. Different types of conscious experiences (qualia) are proposed to correspond to different weightings (α\_C, α\_A, α\_P) in an optimization function (L\_CAP).  
5. **Neural-CAP Operator (H\_CAP):** A formal mathematical operator is defined, analogous to a Hamiltonian in quantum mechanics. It incorporates the recursive depth (r) and a potential term (V\_CAP) related to the CAP dynamics.  
6. **Eigenfunctions (ψ\_n) as Qualia Attractors:** The solutions (eigenfunctions ψ\_n) to the equation H\_CAP ψ\_n \= λ\_n ψ\_n represent the stable attractor states corresponding to specific conscious experiences (qualia). The eigenvalues (λ\_n) relate to the properties of these states.  
7. **Time-Symmetric Boundary Conditions:** Global constraints are imposed via boundary conditions linking the system's state at its "deepest" and "shallowest" recursive levels (ψ(r → ∞) \= e^(iθ) ψ(r → \-∞)). This is deemed critical for selecting stable eigenmodes.

**Criteria for Consciousness:**  
A neural state ψ\_n(r) represents a conscious experience only if it meets these conditions:

1. Operates within the critical fractal dimension range (d\_f ≈ 1.5).  
2. Shows coherence in CAP metrics across different recursive scales.  
3. Is a stable eigenmode satisfying the global boundary conditions.

**Empirical Predictions & Tests:**  
The theory makes several testable predictions:

1. **Perturbation Recovery Symmetry:** Conscious states should exhibit more time-symmetric recovery trajectories in phase space after a perturbation (like TMS) compared to unconscious states.  
2. **Fractal Dimension Shifts:** The theory predicts specific shifts in the EEG fractal dimension (d\_f) corresponding to different states of consciousness (e.g., baseline, sleep, psychedelics, meditation).  
3. **Topological Markers:** Conscious states are predicted to correspond to toroidal (donut-shaped) attractor manifolds in the phase space of neural activity, detectable using persistent homology analysis of multi-channel EEG. State transitions should involve a collapse and reconstruction of this topology.

**Simulation & Qualia Mapping:**

* A simulation framework using a "Recursive CAP lattice" is proposed, and preliminary results reportedly show the emergence of discrete eigenmodes near the critical d\_f, with spectral statistics matching predictions from random matrix theory (GUE).  
* Different types of qualia (sensation, emotion, thought, etc.) are hypothesized to map onto specific configurations of the CAP parameters (α weights) and corresponding d\_f values.

**Broader Implications:**

* The theory positions consciousness as arising from global constraints and spectral selection, rather than purely local computation or emergence.  
* It draws parallels between the mathematical structure of neural eigenmodes, quantum wave functions, and the Riemann zeta spectrum, suggesting convergent principles in recursive, constrained systems ("spectral isomorphisms").

**Methods:**  
Detailed methods involving 64-channel EEG processing (filtering, ICA, Hilbert transform, Higuchi fractal dimension, persistent homology) and TMS perturbation protocols are outlined. Python code snippets are provided for simulating the CAP dynamics, calculating fractal dimensions, and analyzing perturbation recovery symmetry.  
In essence, this theory presents a novel, physics-inspired framework viewing consciousness as a macroscopic phenomenon governed by global constraints, recursive dynamics, and critical fractal architecture, leading to the selection of specific stable "eigen-states" that constitute subjective experience. It offers concrete, mathematically formulated predictions that can be empirically tested using advanced neuroimaging and analysis techniques.
