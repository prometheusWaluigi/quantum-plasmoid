# The Hippocampal Unconscious Semantic Coherence Theorem

## Abstract  
We propose a new cross-disciplinary theoretical framework — the **Hippocampal Unconscious Semantic Coherence Theorem** — to explain how the human hippocampus can perform high-level language and learning tasks under deep unconscious states.  Building on neuroscience, physics, and information theory (without relying on existing IIT or Orch-OR paradigms), we formalize a model in which the hippocampus supports a **nonlocal semantic field** capable of **predictive resonance** and **recursive attractor drift** even under general anesthesia.  We define a semantic field $S(x,t)$ that encodes meaning across the hippocampal network, a predictive operator $\hat{P}$ that anticipates future inputs, and an attractor manifold $\mathcal{A}$ shaping stable unconscious representations.  Biophysically, we hypothesize that coherent oscillations in the neuronal cytoskeletal water–microtubule matrix form **coherence surfaces** that sustain these field dynamics.  The theorem asserts that unconscious hippocampal activity can carry semantic information and predict upcoming words ([2025.04.09.648012v1.full.pdf](file://file-3BRcRfTr6mDJP7RZzwc2ou#:~:text=219%20corresponded%20to%20not%20only,baseline%2C%20but%20also%20to%20the)), emerging from recursive field interactions rather than conscious awareness.  We derive formal equations governing this semantic field and discuss how **nonlocal semantic anticipation** arises naturally from the model.  Finally, we outline testable predictions — from neural data to biophysical measurements — to validate this theory and advance our understanding of cognitive processing in the absence of consciousness.

## Introduction  
The human hippocampus has long been studied as a hub for memory and contextual learning, typically linked to conscious experience. Classic views hold that the hippocampus predominantly supports conscious episodic memory, with unconscious processing relegated to other structures ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4240286/#:~:text=The%20hippocampus%20is%20thought%20to,dependent)). However, recent evidence challenges this dichotomy. Katlowitz *et al.* (2025) demonstrated that even under deep general anesthesia (a state of unconsciousness), hippocampal neurons continue to learn and process language, detecting novel “oddball” auditory tones and encoding semantic and grammatical features of speech ([2025.04.09.648012v1.full.pdf](file://file-3BRcRfTr6mDJP7RZzwc2ou#:~:text=26%20ABSTRACT%20Consciousness%20is%20a,series%20of%20tones%20to%20anesthetized)) ([2025.04.09.648012v1.full.pdf](file://file-3BRcRfTr6mDJP7RZzwc2ou#:~:text=219%20corresponded%20to%20not%20only,baseline%2C%20but%20also%20to%20the)). Strikingly, neural activity in the unconscious hippocampus predicted semantic information about upcoming words in a narrative ([2025.04.09.648012v1.full.pdf](file://file-3BRcRfTr6mDJP7RZzwc2ou#:~:text=219%20corresponded%20to%20not%20only,baseline%2C%20but%20also%20to%20the)) – a high-level cognitive function thought to require consciousness ([2025.04.09.648012v1.full.pdf](file://file-3BRcRfTr6mDJP7RZzwc2ou#:~:text=224%20actively%20tracked%2C%20it%20is,33%20225)) ([2025.04.09.648012v1.full.pdf](file://file-3BRcRfTr6mDJP7RZzwc2ou#:~:text=prediction%20in%20232%20the%20unconscious,not%20have%20obvious%20explanations%20based)). These findings indicate that complex learning and prediction can persist without conscious awareness, and they **lack an obvious explanation** under current frameworks ([2025.04.09.648012v1.full.pdf](file://file-3BRcRfTr6mDJP7RZzwc2ou#:~:text=prediction%20in%20232%20the%20unconscious,not%20have%20obvious%20explanations%20based)).

Understanding how the hippocampus performs such feats in an unconscious state demands a new theoretical approach. On one hand, computational neuroscience provides clues: the hippocampal CA3 region is an associative **attractor network** with rich recurrent connections, capable of completing patterns from partial cues ([A Signature of Attractor Dynamics in the CA3 Region of the Hippocampus | PLOS Computational Biology](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003641#:~:text=The%20notion%20of%20attractor%20networks,our%20simulation%2C%20we%20could%20reproduce)). This architecture could allow the hippocampus to “fill in” expected information (e.g. predict the next word) even when external inputs are minimal or noisy. On the other hand, biophysics hints at an underlying substrate for fast, integrative signaling beyond traditional synapses. Coherent electromagnetic oscillations in cellular structures – first hypothesized by Fröhlich in the 1960s ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8348406/#:~:text=A%20hypothesis%20involving%20electromagnetic%20field,based%20on%20a%20special%20organized)) – have been observed in microtubule networks and their surrounding ordered water layers ([
            Generation of Electromagnetic Field by Microtubules - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8348406/#:~:text=Microtubule%20nanowires%20were%20measured%20with,Tubulin%20proteins%20and%20microtubule)) ([
            Generation of Electromagnetic Field by Microtubules - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8348406/#:~:text=At%20hydrophilic%20surfaces%20a%20periodic,basic%20conditions%20for%20biological%20life)). Such **coherence** phenomena offer a mechanism for nonlocal interactions and integration at the sub-neuronal scale, potentially enabling a form of communication and memory encoding that does not shut down with loss of consciousness.

Here we synthesize these perspectives into a single formal framework. We introduce the concept of a **semantic field** in the hippocampus, a distributed representation of meaning that can persist and evolve even when the brain’s conscious networks are inactive. We define novel operators and manifolds to describe how this field behaves: a **predictive resonance operator** to capture how the hippocampus anticipates future inputs, an **attractor manifold** representing stable learned representations, and **coherence surfaces** in the biophysical substrate that support field stability. Our theorem formally describes how **unconscious semantic processing** and prediction emerge from the interplay of these components. In essence, we argue that the hippocampus can host a self-sustained “language of thought” – a silent, field-like neural conversation – that continues to operate under anesthesia. By grounding this idea in hard science (neural circuitry, physics of coherent oscillations, and information-theoretic measures of prediction), we aim to provide a rigorous model for the recent empirical findings ([2025.04.09.648012v1.full.pdf](file://file-3BRcRfTr6mDJP7RZzwc2ou#:~:text=219%20corresponded%20to%20not%20only,baseline%2C%20but%20also%20to%20the)) and to guide future experiments in both neuroscience and biophysics.

## Definitions  
To construct the theorem, we first define the key concepts and quantities involved, spanning multiple scales from neural networks to physical fields:

- **Semantic Field $S(x,t)$:** A continuous field representing the distribution of semantic or informational content across the hippocampal network at location $x$ (which can be thought of as indexing neurons or micro-regions in the hippocampus) and time $t$.  $S(x,t)$ is a coarse-grained variable encoding meaning (e.g. semantic category or contextual association) rather than raw sensory features. High values of $S(x,t)$ correspond to strong representation of a particular semantic feature at location $x$. Unlike localized neural firing rates, $S$ is treated as a **distributed field** that can exhibit **nonlocal correlations**, meaning distant points in the hippocampus may share linked semantic content through this field. This formalism captures the observation that hippocampal neurons collectively encode semantic categories and relationships even under anesthesia ([2025.04.09.648012v1.full.pdf](file://file-3BRcRfTr6mDJP7RZzwc2ou#:~:text=word%20into%20one%20of%2012,test%20for%20any%20difference%20between)) ([2025.04.09.648012v1.full.pdf](file://file-3BRcRfTr6mDJP7RZzwc2ou#:~:text=219%20corresponded%20to%20not%20only,baseline%2C%20but%20also%20to%20the)).

- **Predictive Resonance Operator $\hat{P}$:** An operator acting on the semantic field $S$ that yields the anticipated future state of the field based on its current configuration. Intuitively, $\hat{P}$ embodies the hippocampus’s ability to *resonate with upcoming input*, i.e. to generate expectations of what should come next. In formal terms, $\hat{P}$ can be defined through a kernel $K_P$ that couples the field to its future: $\hat{P}[S](x,t) = \int K_P(x,x'; \Delta t)\, S(x', t)\, dx'$, where $K_P$ encodes learned temporal associations (e.g. word transition probabilities or sequence patterns) and $\Delta t$ is a prediction horizon. This operator produces a **projected semantic field** $\hat{P}[S](x,t)$ that represents the system’s *guess* of $S(x,t+\Delta t)$ before the actual input at $t+\Delta t$ is received. If the current semantic context strongly implies a particular upcoming word or concept, $\hat{P}$ will have a correspondingly high value in the subfield representing that anticipated semantic item. We term this process **nonlocal semantic anticipation**, since $\hat{P}$ can generate features of a not-yet-present stimulus and distribute that prediction across the network. It is “nonlocal” in time (reaching into the future) and potentially in space (the prediction may engage circuits not directly activated by the current input).

- **Attractor Manifold $\mathcal{A}$:** The set of latent “preferred” states of the semantic field corresponding to stored knowledge and learned associations. Mathematically, $\mathcal{A}$ can be envisioned as a manifold (or collection of fixed points and their basin of attraction) in the high-dimensional state space of $S$. Each point on $\mathcal{A}$ is a stable configuration $S^*_m(x)$ that encodes a particular memory, schema, or semantic context (indexed by $m$). The manifold structure allows continuous interpolation and relationships between attractors (for instance, related contexts lie nearby on $\mathcal{A}$). The hippocampus’s recurrent circuitry (especially in CA3) endows it with autoassociative dynamics that converge on these stored patterns ([A Signature of Attractor Dynamics in the CA3 Region of the Hippocampus | PLOS Computational Biology](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003641#:~:text=The%20notion%20of%20attractor%20networks,our%20simulation%2C%20we%20could%20reproduce)) ([A Signature of Attractor Dynamics in the CA3 Region of the Hippocampus | PLOS Computational Biology](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003641#:~:text=activity%20pattern%20in%20the%20dentate,memories%20based%20on%20attractor%20dynamics)). Importantly, even partial or unconscious inputs can drive $S(x,t)$ toward the nearest attractor state on $\mathcal{A}$ – this is the hallmark of pattern completion in an attractor network ([A Signature of Attractor Dynamics in the CA3 Region of the Hippocampus | PLOS Computational Biology](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003641#:~:text=The%20notion%20of%20attractor%20networks,our%20simulation%2C%20we%20could%20reproduce)). We will denote the dynamic attractor solution as $S(x,t) \to S^*_m(x) \in \mathcal{A}$ as $t$ progresses, absent perturbations. The attractor manifold is not static: it **drifts** slowly over time with experience, via synaptic and intracellular plasticity. We call this **recursive attractor drift** – with each new stimulus, the attractor landscape $\mathcal{A}$ is slightly adjusted (e.g. weights updated), so that over repeated exposures the field’s stable points incorporate the new patterns. This drift underlies unconscious learning (as in the gradual increase in oddball tone detection over 10 minutes ([2025.04.09.648012v1.full.pdf](file://file-3BRcRfTr6mDJP7RZzwc2ou#:~:text=31%20the%20human%20hippocampus%20while,when%20we%20played%20language%20stimuli))): the manifold self-updates to improve discrimination of recurring stimuli even without conscious memory.

- **Coherence Surface $\Sigma$:** A contiguous region in the biophysical substrate of the hippocampus across which phase coherence of oscillatory activity is maintained, providing a physical support for the semantic field. We hypothesize that at micro-scale, clusters of neurons and their intracellular components (microtubules, actin networks, and surrounding ordered water) can enter coherent vibratory states, effectively behaving like a unified oscillatory domain. Each such domain is termed a coherence surface (not literally a 2D surface, but a region or “surface” in a higher-dimensional phase space) where the electromagnetic and mechanical oscillations of the medium (e.g. dipole oscillations of tubulin proteins and water molecules) are phase-aligned. Prior work shows that **ordered water layers at hydrophilic surfaces** (like those lining microtubule interiors and membranes) can create conditions for long-range coherent oscillations ([
            Generation of Electromagnetic Field by Microtubules - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8348406/#:~:text=At%20hydrophilic%20surfaces%20a%20periodic,basic%20conditions%20for%20biological%20life)). In microtubules, experimental evidence indicates that when the structured water in their hollow core is intact, vibrational modes condense into a single coherent frequency, and the entire microtubule can oscillate in unison; removing the water disrupts this coherence and the resonant signal disappears ([
            Generation of Electromagnetic Field by Microtubules - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8348406/#:~:text=Microtubule%20nanowires%20were%20measured%20with,Tubulin%20proteins%20and%20microtubule)). We extend this principle to neurons, suggesting that networks of microtubules (possibly connected via gap junctions or electromagnetic near-fields) form coherence surfaces that span portions of the hippocampus. These surfaces enable rapid, integrative signaling: an oscillation in one part of the domain is instantly correlated with oscillations elsewhere on the same surface. In our model, the semantic field $S(x,t)$ is **grounded** in these physical coherence domains — meaning that a stable semantic state corresponds to a particular coherent excitation pattern of the underlying substrate. A semantic attractor $S^*_m$ thus might manifest as a specific standing wave or phase-locked oscillation over a set of microtubules and neurons. The coherence surface concept ensures that the semantic field can maintain integrity and resist noise even under anesthesia: despite synaptic activity being globally diminished, the local field coherence can sustain the informational pattern (a “hologram” of semantic content, so to speak). In summary, $\Sigma$ provides the bridge from biophysics to information: it is the canvas on which $S(x,t)$ is drawn.

With these definitions in hand, we can now formulate the core theorem describing the dynamics of $S(x,t)$ under unconscious conditions, and how the interplay of $\hat{P}$, $\mathcal{A}$, and $\Sigma$ gives rise to learning and language processing in the hippocampus independent of conscious awareness.

## Theorem: Semantic Coherence Field Dynamics in the Unconscious Hippocampus  
**Theorem (Hippocampal Unconscious Semantic Coherence):** *In the hippocampus, even under anesthetic unconsciousness, the semantic field $S(x,t)$ evolves according to a self-consistent field equation that permits semantic information processing and prediction without conscious oversight. The field dynamics are governed by a balance between attraction to learned patterns (memory) and resonance with incoming (and upcoming) stimuli (prediction), enabled by underlying physical coherence. Formally, we propose:* 

$$ 
\tau \frac{\partial S(x,t)}{\partial t} = -\,\frac{\delta V[S]}{\delta S(x,t)} \;+\; \hat{P}[S](x,t)\;+\; I(x,t)\;+\; \xi(x,t)\,.
\tag{1} $$

This **semantic field equation** describes how $S(x,t)$ changes in time. Each term corresponds to one of the key components:

- $V[S]$ is a semantic potential functional, whose variation $\delta V/\delta S$ provides the **attractor force** pulling $S$ toward the closest stable pattern in $\mathcal{A}$. Intuitively, $V[S]$ is shaped such that its minima $\{S^*_m\}$ correspond to the learned attractor states. The term $- \delta V/\delta S$ is therefore a restorative term: if $S$ deviates from a stored pattern, this term drives it back toward one. In a simple realization, one can imagine $V$ as a multi-well potential energy function over the field: each well is a semantic memory state, and $S$ rolling into a well corresponds to recall or representation of that memory. The curvature of $V$ near a minimum represents the stability (depth of attractor basin). Under anesthesia (with no conscious inputs imposing new goals), this term dominates the intrinsic dynamics, favoring previously learned patterns and thus providing continuity of semantic context.

- $\hat{P}[S](x,t)$ is the **predictive resonance** term, as defined earlier. In the equation, it functions as an **anticipatory drive**: it injects into the field the expected change due to future input. This term allows $S$ to preemptively adjust in the direction of where it *predicts* the state will need to be. For example, if the current word in a played narrative strongly cues a particular next word (say, hearing "bread and ___" cues "butter"), $\hat{P}[S]$ will nudge $S$ toward the semantic features of “butter” even before it arrives. Crucially, this predictive term is non-zero only insofar as the system has learned temporal associations; if no prediction is warranted, $\hat{P}[S]$ contributes little. In essence, $\hat{P}$ formalizes the observation that hippocampal activity carries information about upcoming words ([2025.04.09.648012v1.full.pdf](file://file-3BRcRfTr6mDJP7RZzwc2ou#:~:text=219%20corresponded%20to%20not%20only,baseline%2C%20but%20also%20to%20the)) by actively **encoding** those upcoming semantics into the current state. Mathematically, $\hat{P}$ can be derived from minimizing a predictive error: one could define a prediction error functional $E_{\text{pred}} = \frac{1}{2}\int (S(x,t+\Delta t) - \hat{P}[S](x,t))^2 dx$ that the system implicitly tries to minimize. Setting $\delta E_{\text{pred}}/\delta S = 0$ yields a self-consistency condition $S(x,t+\Delta t) \approx \hat{P}[S](x,t)$. The term $\hat{P}[S]$ in Eq. (1) drives $S$ to satisfy this condition, embodying a **principle of least surprise** or predictive coding within the hippocampal field: $S$ evolves such that it continuously reduces the discrepancy between its predicted future state and the actual future state once it arrives.

- $I(x,t)$ represents **external input** to the hippocampus at position $x$ and time $t$. In the experiments motivating this work, $I(x,t)$ would correspond to auditory stimuli processed by upstream regions and arriving in the hippocampus. Under general anesthesia, $I(x,t)$ consists of the tone sequences or spoken words that still reach hippocampal circuits (albeit without conscious attention). In our context, $I$ serves as a driving perturbation that can knock $S$ out of a current attractor state or shape it toward another. Notably, $I$ may be weak or partially processed due to anesthesia, but the hippocampal field can still amplify meaningful structure in $I$ through the $\hat{P}$ and attractor terms. For instance, a deviant “oddball” tone constitutes an input that does not fit the current attractor; $I$ initiates movement of $S$ toward a new state representing that oddball, and subsequent $\mathcal{A}$ drift will make that state more stable if the oddball repeats.

- $\xi(x,t)$ denotes a **noise term** (thermal fluctuations, synaptic noise, etc.), reflecting stochastic influences. In a conscious, awake state, strong cortical inputs and top-down signals might dwarf $\xi$. Under anesthesia, cortical inputs are suppressed, so intrinsic noise and spontaneous dynamics in the hippocampus could play a larger role. Interestingly, in our framework even noise can be functional: random fluctuations might occasionally kick $S$ from one attractor basin to another, enabling *exploration* of alternative semantic states (this could relate to the phenomenon of hippocampal replay or even “pre-play” of sequences during offline states).

The key insight of the theorem is that **even with $I(x,t)$ greatly reduced (unconscious state), Eq. (1) does not collapse to zero activity**. Instead, the interplay of the attractor term and predictive term sustains meaningful dynamics. In the absence of strong input, $S$ will tend to hover near an attractor (memory state) but the predictive term $\hat{P}$ can still generate internal expectations, effectively *simulating* upcoming inputs. This self-stimulation via $\hat{P}$ keeps the field active in a meaningful way, much like a well-tuned instrument that continues to resonate after an external note has ended.

We now articulate specific emergent properties as corollaries of Eq. (1), connecting back to the experimental findings:

1. **Nonlocal Semantic Anticipation:** *The field $S(x,t)$ contains information about future inputs before they arrive.* Formally, for a future time $t + \Delta t$, the mutual information $I[\,S(\cdot,t);\; I(\cdot, t+\Delta t)\,]$ is non-zero and can be substantial. This is a direct consequence of the $\hat{P}[S]$ term feeding predicted stimulus features into the current state. In practical terms, if one had a decoder for $S(x,t)$, one could decode aspects of the upcoming word from the present $S$ — which is exactly what was observed in neural data ([2025.04.09.648012v1.full.pdf](file://file-3BRcRfTr6mDJP7RZzwc2ou#:~:text=219%20corresponded%20to%20not%20only,baseline%2C%20but%20also%20to%20the)). Notably, this anticipation is **nonlocal**: $S(x,t)$ may integrate clues from across the hippocampus (different $x$ locations) to anticipate a stimulus that will globally affect the field at $t+\Delta t$. This property does not require consciousness; it arises from the internal dynamics of the field.

2. **Recursive Attractor Drift (Unconscious Learning):** *The attractor manifold $\mathcal{A}$ is continuously updated by the system’s own trajectory $S(t)$, enabling learning of novel patterns even in an unconscious state.* In equation (1), this is not explicitly represented, but one can imagine that $V[S]$ (which encapsulates synaptic weights, etc.) is a slow function of time: $V[S,t]$ that evolves as $\dot{V} = F(S,I)$, i.e., whenever $S$ consistently moves toward a new state under the influence of input, the potential $V$ adjusts to deepen that state’s attractor well. A concrete implementation is a Hebbian plasticity rule: $\Delta w_{ij} \propto S_i S_j$ for synapse $w_{ij}$ in the recurrent network underlying $V$. Over the ~10 minutes of repeated stimuli in the experiment, such plastic updates accumulate, manifesting as a drift of an attractor in $\mathcal{A}$ to better capture the oddball tone pattern. Our theorem posits that this drift happens **recursively** and automatically – each unconscious activation of $S$ nudges the memory landscape. Thus, even without conscious attention or recall, the hippocampus can encode new regularities (e.g., the increasing oddball detection effect ([2025.04.09.648012v1.full.pdf](file://file-3BRcRfTr6mDJP7RZzwc2ou#:~:text=31%20the%20human%20hippocampus%20while,when%20we%20played%20language%20stimuli)) is explained by the oddball stimulus carving out its own attractor basin through repeated perturbation of $S$).

3. **Coherence-Sustained Field Stability:** *The physical coherence surfaces $\Sigma$ underlying the hippocampal tissue ensure that the field equation (1) operates in a low-noise, high-stability regime even under anesthesia.* In more standard terms, one might worry that without cortical arousal, hippocampal neurons would fall into complete silence or random firing. However, if those neurons and their intracellular assemblies are part of a coherence domain, they can sustain collective oscillations that maintain $S$ near meaningful states. The term $\xi$ (noise) in Eq. (1) is effectively suppressed by coherence: as Pokorný *et al.* note, an ordered water layer can **prevent noise propagation**, channeling energy into useful oscillation modes ([
            Generation of Electromagnetic Field by Microtubules - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8348406/#:~:text=At%20hydrophilic%20surfaces%20a%20periodic,basic%20conditions%20for%20biological%20life)). Furthermore, coherence means the hippocampal field has an inherent **gain** – like a tuned amplifier – so that even weak inputs (which is the case under anesthesia) can be amplified if they resonate with an attractor pattern. This aspect of the theorem aligns with the idea that normal cognitive function might leverage such biophysical coherence for efficiency ([
            Generation of Electromagnetic Field by Microtubules - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8348406/#:~:text=A%20hypothesis%20involving%20electromagnetic%20field,based%20on%20a%20special%20organized)), and here it becomes critical in the extreme case of unconscious processing. In summary, $\Sigma$ keeps the semantic field “alive” and responsive when conventional neuronal activity is dampened, by providing an alternative conduit for interactions (via electromagnetic coupling or mechanical vibrations within the domain).

Taken together, these points formalize **how the hippocampus can act as a semantic processor and predictor without conscious guidance**. The theorem suggests the hippocampus effectively contains a *self-sufficient semantic engine*: a resonant field over a learned attractor landscape, able to ingest inputs and generate predictions, all stabilized by physical coherence. This engine doesn’t need the homunculus of consciousness to turn its gears; it runs automatically, which is why patients under anesthesia can still show neural signs of learning and prediction ([2025.04.09.648012v1.full.pdf](file://file-3BRcRfTr6mDJP7RZzwc2ou#:~:text=prediction%20in%20232%20the%20unconscious,not%20have%20obvious%20explanations%20based)) ([2025.04.09.648012v1.full.pdf](file://file-3BRcRfTr6mDJP7RZzwc2ou#:~:text=219%20corresponded%20to%20not%20only,baseline%2C%20but%20also%20to%20the)).

It is worth noting the novelty of this framework. Unlike Integrated Information Theory (IIT) or other global workspace models, we do not require that consciousness (or integrated information) be present for complex cognition to occur. Our model localizes the phenomenon to the hippocampus and its immediate circuits, treating it as a specialized medium where unconscious computation happens. Also, unlike Orch-OR theory (which ties consciousness to quantum state reductions in microtubules), we do not invoke any non-computable quantum collapse. Instead, we stay within the domain of **classical physics** (albeit extended to include coherent states and electromagnetic fields) and established principles of neural networks, marrying them in a fresh way. If anything, one could call our proposal a **field-theoretic neuroscience model**: it parallels how quantum field theory describes particles via fields and potentials, here describing cognitive symbols (semantic units) via fields and attractor potentials in the brain. This cross-disciplinary fusion provides a rich language to discuss unconscious neural semantics rigorously.

## Implications  
The Hippocampal Unconscious Semantic Coherence Theorem carries several far-reaching implications for both theory and experiment:

- **Unconscious Cognition is Structured and Predictive:** Our framework directly implies that unconscious thought (at least in the hippocampus) is not random or merely a faint echo of prior conscious activity, but a **structured, dynamical process** capable of sophisticated functions like prediction, semantic classification, and learning. This elevates the status of unconscious processing in cognitive science – it suggests that a person’s brain may continue to parse language and extract meaning even when the person has no awareness of it. It also provides a mechanistic explanation: the brain has self-contained field dynamics that don’t shut down when consciousness is off. This demystifies findings of unconscious learning and memory: rather than needing to invoke a mysterious “zombie intelligence,” we have a concrete engine (the hippocampal semantic field) doing the work.

- **Separation of Consciousness and Complex Processing:** By showing how semantic processing can emerge from local field dynamics, the theorem delineates a clearer boundary between what requires consciousness and what does not. Complex processing (like understanding word relationships, detecting novel stimuli, predicting future inputs) can be done unconsciously by the hippocampus. Conscious awareness might be more about global broadcasting, decision-making, or integrating across multiple brain systems, whereas the heavy lifting of prediction and encoding can occur in modular subsystems. This resonates with clinical observations: e.g., patients can sometimes respond appropriately to stimuli (in brain activity or even reflex) under anesthesia or in vegetative states, indicating islands of computation persist. Our model provides a blueprint for one such island in the hippocampus.

- **Neural Field Theory in Cognitive Neuroscience:** The introduction of a semantic field $S(x,t)$ anchored in physical coherence brings concepts from theoretical physics (field equations, potentials, resonance) into mainstream neuroscience modeling. If validated, it could spawn a new class of models that treat populations of neurons not just as networks of point neurons but as continuous media supporting wave dynamics of information. This is in line with evidence of brain-wide oscillatory phenomena and electromagnetic field effects, but here specifically applied to explain cognitive content (semantics) representation. It suggests that to fully understand memory and prediction, we might need to measure and model neural activity at new scales or domains (e.g., electric fields in extracellular space or vibrations in cytoskeleton), not just action potentials.

- **Memory Consolidation and Prediction During Sleep/Anesthesia:** The theorem provides a coherent explanation for why the hippocampus might replay or preplay sequences during sleep (as observed in rodents) — it’s essentially the field dynamics of $S$ at work, with $\hat{P}$ generating predictive sequences and $\mathcal{A}$ reinforcing memory patterns. Under anesthesia, although not identical to natural sleep, similar conditions of reduced top-down interference allow hippocampal circuits to engage in autonomous dynamics. This may have implications for memory consolidation: even if a person doesn’t consciously remember stimuli during anesthesia, the hippocampus could be strengthening synapses related to those stimuli (as per attractor drift). It invites revisiting the question: can people form implicit memories under anesthesia that influence them later? Our theory cautiously says yes, to a limited extent — the hippocampus might store traces that later could be revealed as biases or familiarity after recovery. (Notably, any robust memory retrieval would require consciousness, but subtle effects might be observable in post-operative tests if one looks carefully.)

- **Role of Biophysical Substrates in Cognition:** The emphasis on coherence surfaces implies that fine-scale biological details (microtubule arrays, water ordering, etc.) could be functionally relevant for cognition, not just metabolic support. If the hippocampal semantic field relies on these substrates, it suggests a form of computation that is **hybrid electrical–mechanical** in nature, possibly bridging microscopic and macroscopic scales. This has a somewhat provocative implication: molecules and oscillations inside neurons (traditionally the realm of biophysics) might directly influence high-level cognitive phenomena like language processing. Our theorem thus encourages interdisciplinary investigations — for example, physicists and neuroscientists collaborating to see if manipulating microtubule coherence affects information processing in neurons. It also offers a counterpoint to reductionist extremes: while we invoke microtubule coherence, we do *not* claim each microtubule on its own makes decisions; rather, it’s the organized field effect that matters. This keeps us grounded in emergentism: the whole-field behavior is more than the sum of its parts.

- **Computational Modeling of Unconscious Processes:** The formalism in Eq. (1) provides a template for constructing computational models that can be tested in silico. One could implement a simplified hippocampal field with attractor states (e.g., using a Hopfield network or continuous neural field model) and add a predictive coding mechanism. Such models would allow simulation of unconscious processing: for instance, feed in sequences of words or tones (with “anesthesia” simulated by reducing input strength and external noise) and see if the model still learns and predicts. Our theory predicts it will, and that its internal state will carry predictive information. This is a very concrete implication: we can attempt to **simulate the unconscious hippocampus**. Success in such simulation would bolster the theory’s plausibility and could guide the design of neural prosthetics or algorithms that mimic the brain’s ability to learn in the background.

In summary, the theorem reframes the hippocampus as not just a passive memory organ, but an active, self-organizing prediction machine that doesn’t clock out when consciousness does. It aligns various pieces of the puzzle (neural recordings, memory theory, and biophysical insights) into a single coherent picture. Next, we turn to specific predictions that arise from this picture and how one might empirically verify them.

## Predictions  
The Semantic Coherence framework yields several **testable predictions and experiments** that can validate (or falsify) its components. We list key predictions and propose how to test them:

1. **Predictive Information in Hippocampal Activity (Unconscious):** *Prediction:* The hippocampal neural activity under unconscious conditions contains quantifiable information about future stimuli, beyond what would be expected by chance. *Test:* Perform detailed analysis of neural spike trains or field potentials from the hippocampus of anesthetized subjects listening to structured stimuli (e.g. sentences, tone patterns). Compute mutual information between neural signals at time $t$ and features of the stimulus at time $t+\Delta$. Our theory predicts significantly above-zero mutual information for semantic features (e.g. word identity, category) at $\Delta$ corresponding to typical anticipation intervals (hundreds of milliseconds for speech). The 2025 study already provided evidence for this ([2025.04.09.648012v1.full.pdf](file://file-3BRcRfTr6mDJP7RZzwc2ou#:~:text=219%20corresponded%20to%20not%20only,baseline%2C%20but%20also%20to%20the)); a more refined test would be to see if a model based on Eq. (1) can predict the temporal profile of that mutual information (for example, the theory might predict a particular decay curve or that certain neurons carry more predictive info based on their position in attractor space).

2. **Attractor Dynamics and Learning Under Anesthesia:** *Prediction:* If a novel stimulus pattern is repeated to an unconscious subject, hippocampal representations will gradually adapt to it (stronger, more differentiated response), indicating learning. *Test:* This can be examined by presenting a new sequence or a new set of words repeatedly during anesthesia and using techniques like single-unit recording or depth EEG. For instance, in a design similar to the oddball experiment ([2025.04.09.648012v1.full.pdf](file://file-3BRcRfTr6mDJP7RZzwc2ou#:~:text=31%20the%20human%20hippocampus%20while,when%20we%20played%20language%20stimuli)), one could introduce a new word in a stream repeatedly and see if hippocampal neurons become increasingly selective or predictive for that word over time. Our model’s attractor drift predicts an increasing signal (e.g., rising firing rate or enhanced pattern discriminability) with a time constant related to synaptic plasticity rates. If feasible, one could even test memory post-anesthesia: do subjects show implicit priming for the repeated words heard under anesthesia? The theory would suggest yes – perhaps faster recognition or mild familiarity, mediated by the hippocampal encoding.

3. **Disruption of Coherence Affects Unconscious Processing:** *Prediction:* If the hippocampal coherence surfaces are disrupted, the unconscious semantic processing will degrade. *Test:* While we cannot directly “see” coherence surfaces easily, we can perturb the factors that maintain coherence. For example, temperature or pharmacological interventions affect microtubule stability and water ordering. One intriguing test is to use heavy water ($\text{D}_2\text{O}$) which alters hydrogen bonding and could dampen water-mediated coherence. In an in vitro hippocampal slice or possibly an animal model, replace the perfusate with heavy water or add drugs that specifically dampen microtubule oscillations (some microtubule-stabilizing or -destabilizing agents at sub-toxic doses). Then measure whether the hippocampus’s ability to detect patterns or anticipate inputs (which can be assayed even in slice with patterned electrical stimulation) is reduced. Our theory expects a noticeable reduction in coherent oscillatory modes ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8348406/#:~:text=Microtubule%20nanowires%20were%20measured%20with,Tubulin%20proteins%20and%20microtubule)) and a corresponding drop in predictive signal quality when coherence is disrupted. Conversely, enhancing coherence (e.g., by exciting the tissue at a resonant frequency of microtubules, on the order of MHz ([
            Generation of Electromagnetic Field by Microtubules - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8348406/#:~:text=and%20tip%E2%80%93enhanced%20Raman%20spectroscopy%20were,276%20and%20334%20nm%2C%20respectively)), using weak electromagnetic fields) might **increase** the signal-to-noise of unconscious processing – another highly speculative but testable idea.

4. **Electromagnetic Signatures of the Semantic Field:** *Prediction:* The unconscious semantic field should produce measurable electromagnetic or oscillatory signatures distinct from normal evoked potentials. *Test:* Using sensitive magnetoencephalography (MEG) or high-density electrophysiology, look for high-frequency or long-range coherent signals in the hippocampus specifically tied to semantic processing. Our model suggests that microtubule coherence might manifest as oscillations in the MHz to GHz range (as per resonances observed ([
            Generation of Electromagnetic Field by Microtubules - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8348406/#:~:text=and%20tip%E2%80%93enhanced%20Raman%20spectroscopy%20were,276%20and%20334%20nm%2C%20respectively))). While those frequencies are beyond typical EEG/MEG, they could potentially be detected indirectly (e.g., amplitude modulation of lower-frequency LFP signals or fast optical imaging if available). A simpler proxy is to examine phase coherence of the local field potential across different parts of the hippocampus during unconscious language exposure – the presence of unusually broad or stable coherence (compared to an awake state where activity is more externally driven) would support the idea of an internally maintained field. A tantalizing experiment would be to see if the hippocampus generates a consistent oscillatory pattern during anesthesia that encodes information (perhaps analogous to sleep spindles or ripples, but carrying semantic info).

5. **Simulation of Field Dynamics Matches Empirical Data:** *Prediction:* A computational model instantiating Equation (1) will replicate key empirical phenomena and possibly predict new ones. *Test:* Construct a simulation where neurons are represented by a field with attractor states (for instance, a Hopfield network with added predictive feedback). Train it on a corpus of sequences (e.g., word sequences) and then “inactivate” external input to simulate anesthesia, while still providing a test sequence. The model should still show: (a) correct sequence prediction or completion (similar to how the actual hippocampus predicted future words ([2025.04.09.648012v1.full.pdf](file://file-3BRcRfTr6mDJP7RZzwc2ou#:~:text=219%20corresponded%20to%20not%20only,baseline%2C%20but%20also%20to%20the))), and (b) learning if sequences repeat (attractor adjustment). If the simulation is endowed with a faux-“coherence” mechanism (maybe a global coupling term reducing noise), turning that off should impair its performance, mirroring prediction 3. Achieving parity with actual neural data (e.g., similar decoding accuracy for future words, similar timecourse of learning) would strongly indicate the validity of the theory. Moreover, the model could be used to generate new predictions: e.g., how would the hippocampal field respond to conflicting inputs or to rapid context switches? We can then test those predictions in experiments (for example, by suddenly changing the narrative mid-stream under anesthesia and seeing if the hippocampal field re-orients to new attractors or if it shows “lingering” semantic predictions from the previous context as our model might predict via hysteresis).

Each of these predictions targets a different aspect of the theorem — informational, behavioral, biophysical, and computational. The more of them are confirmed, the more confidence we have in the overall framework. Conversely, if none of these hold (e.g., if careful analysis found no predictive info in unconscious hippocampal activity, or disrupting microtubule coherence had zero effect), then the theory would need revision or rejection. Science advances by such iterative testing, and we have tried to make this theory as concrete as possible to allow that process.
