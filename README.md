# Quantum-Plasmoid Framework

## A Fractal-Recursive Approach to Consciousness & Complex Systems

The Quantum-Plasmoid Framework represents a radical interdisciplinary synthesis exploring consciousness, information, and reality through recursive, fractal principles. This research integrates quantum physics, mathematics, neuroscience, and systems theory to develop novel models of emergent complexity.

## Core Principles

The framework is built upon several interconnected principles:

- **Recursive Dynamics**: Self-referential processes that generate complex emergent behaviors through iterative feedback loops
- **Fractal Self-Similarity**: Patterns that maintain structural coherence across scales, from quantum to cosmic
- **Eigenmode Stabilization**: Consciousness as emerging from stable eigenmode solutions within recursively constrained neural systems
- **CAP Optimization**: Critical balance between Consistency, Availability, and Partition-tolerance in complex information networks
- **Spectral Selection**: Consciousness as selective attention to specific eigenmodes within a vast possibility space
