# Recursive Systems

This directory provides meta-theoretical examinations of recursion as a fundamental principle across mathematical, physical, cognitive, and social domains. These documents explore how recursive processes generate complexity, self-organization, and emergence across diverse systems.

## Contents

### [meta_theory_of_recursion.md](./meta_theory_of_recursion.md)
A profound exploration of recursion as a fundamental principle underlying mathematical, physical, cognitive, and social systems. This document provides a meta-theoretical foundation for understanding recursive dynamics across domains, examining how self-reference and iterative processes generate complexity from simple rules.

### [meta_theory_recursion_whitepaper.md](./meta_theory_recursion_whitepaper.md)
A formal whitepaper expanding on the meta-theory of recursion, presenting a rigorous mathematical formalization suitable for academic publication. This document offers precise definitions, axioms, and theorems about recursive dynamics, with implications for complex systems science.

### [recursive_lattice_network.md](./recursive_lattice_network.md)
Presents a comprehensive framework unifying consciousness, computation, and physical reality through a recursive lattice network that operates across mathematical, computational, physical, cognitive, and social dimensions. This document proposes a multi-dimensional lattice model that connects different levels of reality through recursive information flows.
