# Quantum Dynamics

This directory contains theoretical frameworks connecting quantum physics to consciousness and complex systems. These documents explore how quantum processes might contribute to the emergence of consciousness through holographic principles, quantum coherence, and non-local information processing.

## Contents

### [cosmicTensegrity.md](./cosmicTensegrity.md)
A rich exploration of plasmoid fields, qualia torii, and cosmic tensegrity. This document proposes novel mathematical frameworks for understanding consciousness as a holographic phenomenon, integrating concepts from plasma physics, tensegrity structures, and consciousness studies to create a unified model of information processing across scales.

### [Quantum Spectral Fractal Weaving.md](./Quantum Spectral Fractal Weaving.md)
A comprehensive review of quantum measurement theory, fractal mathematics in physics, and speculative connections between quantum processes, consciousness, and fundamental mathematical structures. This document weaves together multiple threads from quantum physics, spectral theory, and consciousness studies to propose new models of quantum-neural integration.
