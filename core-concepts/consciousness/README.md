# Consciousness Theory

This directory contains foundational models of consciousness function, semantic processing, and unconscious dynamics. These documents explore the fundamental nature of consciousness as an information processing phenomenon with recursive, fractal properties.

## Contents

### [Consciousness Function.md](./Consciousness Function.md)
A systematic examination of consciousness as a functional process, proposing specific mechanisms by which awareness emerges from information processing. This document outlines a formal model of consciousness as a dynamic function operating over neural eigenmodes, with specific attention to the binding problem and temporal integration.

### [Consciousness Function and more.md](./Consciousness Function and more.md)
An expanded exploration of consciousness functions, incorporating additional dimensions such as embodiment, collective consciousness, and quantum effects. This document builds upon the base consciousness function model to address more complex aspects of subjective experience.

### [UnconsciousSemanticLattice.md](./UnconsciousSemanticLattice.md)
An investigation into the structure and dynamics of unconscious semantic processing, proposing a lattice-based model of meaning generation below the threshold of awareness. This document examines how unconscious semantic networks influence conscious experience through recursive feedback loops.
