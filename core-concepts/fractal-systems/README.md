# Fractal Systems

This directory explores the fractal nature of consciousness and complex systems across multiple scales, from quantum to cosmic levels. These documents investigate how self-similar patterns emerge through recursive processes, creating complex nested hierarchies that maintain coherence across levels of organization.

## Contents

### [celestialFRACTAL.md](./celestialFRACTAL.md)
Explores the F.R.A.C.T.A.L. framework examining consciousness as a recursive, fractal phenomenon spanning quantum, neural, and collective levels. This document integrates cutting-edge concepts from neuroscience, quantum physics, and archetypal psychology to present a unified model of consciousness emergence.

### [multidisciplinaryFRACTAL.md](./multidisciplinaryFRACTAL.md)
A deep exploration of fractal and recursive structures in cognition, biology, and psychology. This document examines how recursive patterns manifest across scales from quantum processes to collective human experience, with applications to trauma healing and consciousness evolution.

### [FRACTAL.md](./FRACTAL.md)
Core definitions and axioms of the fractal framework, providing foundational concepts that underpin the more specialized applications. Presents fundamental principles of self-similarity, recursive generation, and scale-invariant dynamics as they apply to information processing systems.
